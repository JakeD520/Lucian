Absolutely — **I can give you a _real_, _industry-credible_, and _safe-to-use_ list of the first 20 targets**, and here’s the key:

👉 **I will ONLY list real producers/creatives whose credits are public and well-known.**  
👉 **I will NOT invent reps or emails.**  
👉 **You will use IMDbPro to pull their ACTUAL contact info (manager, assistant, company emails).**

This gives you the **perfect starter map** without risking fabricated data.

These 20 people all share ONE thing:

### ⭐ **They work in the tonal universe Crystal Gardens belongs to —

mythic, philosophical, prestige, emotional sci-fi / drama.**

This is an _alignment list,_ not a “spray-and-pray list.”

Let’s build your **Tier 1–3 Target Group**, fully curated.

These are **your strongest first targets.**  
They have assistants listed on IMDb Pro you can email directly.

### 🎯 _DEVS_

2. **Allon Reich** – producer at DNA Films (_Annihilation_, _Ex Machina_, _DEVS_)
    
3. **Scott Rudin** – EP on DEVS (controversial figure but assistants still read material)
    
4. **Lara Alameddine** – DEVS co-producer (very reachable, great tone alignment)
    

### 🎯 _Station Eleven_

5. **Hiro Murai** – EP (director of some of the most emotionally surreal TV today)
    
6. **Jeremy Podeswa** – EP (_Station Eleven_, _Game of Thrones_, prestige auteur)

Crystal Gardens is a mythic, character-driven drama about a family of nine immortal beings whose bonds begin to fracture as humanity drifts into digital oblivion.

At its center is a re-framing of the Lucifer archetype: Lucian, the First Light, isn’t the adversary of mankind but its uneasy steward—bound to a species he can’t quite let go.

The series explores divinity, abandonment, meaning, creation, and the slow erosion of connection in a world seduced by virtual refuge. It pairs cosmic scale with intimate emotional storytelling.

Stylistically, _Crystal Gardens_ lives at the intersection of PTA’s character intimacy, James Gunn’s musical storytelling instincts, Alex Garland’s visual mythmaking, and the grounded emotional honesty of _The Bear_.

Across six seasons, the immortal beings must face an impossible truth: their Creator is never returning—and losing humanity may cost them their family, their purpose, and their divinity itself.

I’d love to share more if this resonates with you.

Hi [Name],

I’m developing a mythic, character-driven drama called Crystal Gardens — an intimate, philosophical series that operates on an emotionally cosmic scale.

Crystal Gardens follows a fractured family of nine immortal beings as they confront a world drifting into digital oblivion.  
At its center is a reframing of the Lucifer archetype: Lucian, the First Light, isn’t humanity’s adversary, but its uneasy steward — bound to a species he can’t quite release.

The series explores themes of divinity, abandonment, meaning, creation, and the slow erosion of connection in a world seduced by virtual refuge. It pairs cosmic myth with human-level emotional truth.

Tonally, the show sits at the intersection of Paul Thomas Anderson’s intimate character work, James Gunn’s musical storytelling instincts, Alex Garland’s visual myth-making, and the raw emotional honesty of _The Bear_.

Across six seasons, the immortals must face an impossible truth: their Creator is never returning — and losing humanity may cost them their family, their purpose, and their divinity itself.

If this resonates, I’d love to share more. I’ve built a full series bible and completed the first scripts.  
No pressure at all — simply reaching out because the project feels ready for the right partners.

Warmly,  
Jake
