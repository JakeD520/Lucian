### **Scene: “The Mural”**

**EXT. DESERTED HIGHWAY – LATE AFTERNOON**

Heat shimmer. The car hums down a cracked road. Windshield coated in dust.

Jazz leans against the window, zoning out — first quiet she’s had in weeks.

> **JAZZ:** “Wait. Zadie—pull over.”  
> **ZADIE:** “What is it?”  
> **JAZZ:** “Just… stop. There.”

They roll to a halt.  
She gets out, boots crunching gravel.  
Camera follows her slow walk into the wide frame of an **abandoned building**, sun-blasted, ivy creeping up concrete.  
On its wall — a massive, half-faded mural:

**L U C I A N**, haloed in red spray paint, leading zealots as they **smash servers, burn data stacks,** faceless figures in VR rigs fleeing in terror.  
Across the bottom in bold, shaky letters:

> **“CAN’T HANDLE LIFE? WE’LL HELP YOU GET OUT.”**

The air hums with cicadas.  
Jazz stares.  
Her mouth opens slightly—no words.

> **JAZZ:** “…What the fuck.”  
> _(beat)_  
> **ZADIE (soft, already knowing):** “Come on, Jazz. Leave it.”  
> **JAZZ:** “They think this is what he meant?”  
> **ZADIE:** “Doesn’t matter what he meant. People only ever hear what fits.”

She takes a slow step back, eyes still fixed on the wall—equal parts horror and fascination.  
Then she turns, gets back into the car.  
Door shuts. The engine starts.  
As they pull away, the mural slides past the window reflection of her face—Lucian’s painted eyes superimposed over hers for a heartbeat.

Cut to black.
