### **Scene Seed: Lucian’s Vision**

**Setup:**  
A quiet moment. Lucian and [choose: Lyra / Aris / Sara / Maya] are watching humans — maybe in a gallery, or just in a simple, everyday setting (a street, a dinner, laughter spilling out of a tavern). The mood is contemplative, not dramatic.

**Prompt:**  
The companion asks softly, almost teasing:  
_“You watch all this like a critic. But what about you, Lucian? If it were your world — not the Architect’s — what would it look like?”_

**Lucian’s Response (example draft):**  
Lucian pauses, as if the thought is dangerous. He exhales slowly.  
_“It wouldn’t be louder. Or brighter. It would be simpler. A place where no one has to fight their own skin. Where you don’t have to rush to be worthy. Where just breathing… just being here… is enough.”_

He looks down, almost ashamed of having spoken so personally.  
_“But that is only longing. The Architect made the world as it is. Mine is only… a dream.”_
