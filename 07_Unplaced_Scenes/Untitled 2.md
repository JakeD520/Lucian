### **Scene Concept — “The Blackout” (mid-Season 4)**

**Setting:** Evan’s high-rise apartment, Elysium District. Vast windows overlook the shimmering lattice of the central server farms — a skyline of vertical data towers glowing like artificial stars.

**Mood:** Stillness after chaos. The power has failed across the city, but the heavens (the servers) still blaze.

**[INT. ELYSIUM SUITE – NIGHT]**  
A long, steady shot. The room is dark except for the starlike glow from outside.  
Dust motes drift in the pale light. The silence hums louder than machinery ever did.

**KAELARYS**  
(soft, half-smile)  
The world’s gone dark.

**EVAN**  
(looking toward the window)  
Not there.  
(pointing)  
Priority grid. Outages are bad for morale… people panic when they lose connection.

**KAELARYS**  
Delusion keeps them calm.

**EVAN**  
Yeah.  
(beat)  
If they wake too suddenly… bad things happen.  
And restarting those towers—god—it costs more than keeping them lit forever.

Kaelarys watches the golden light on his face — artificial sunrise, mercy for no one.

**KAELARYS**  
You keep the sky burning, so they never see the dark.

**EVAN**  
Maybe the dark’s not ready for them yet.

A slow zoom toward the window: the server city shimmering like a living constellation, while the world beneath is pitch black.

**Sound design:**  
The faint electrical _hum_ becomes indistinguishable from a heartbeat.  
Then — a single flicker in one tower.  
Cut to black.
