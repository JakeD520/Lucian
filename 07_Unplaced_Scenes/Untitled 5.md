### **Scene: “The Plug-House”**

**INT. ROWHOUSE – TWILIGHT**

long tracking shot down a stairwell lit by flickering LED strips.  
low hum of machinery, flies, faint pop of static from old VR gear.

Jazz and Zadie step inside.  
the smell hits first — mold, coolant, bodies that haven’t moved in days.  
rows of makeshift **immersion pods**—bathing tubs, recliners, whatever people could wire up—filled with figures half-submerged in murky gel, neural cables taped to their temples.

some are breathing.  
some aren’t.

> **ZADIE** _(whispering)_: “They couldn’t afford the real rigs.”  
> **JAZZ:** “They made their own.”  
> _(beat)_  
> **ZADIE:** “Guess it worked.”  
> **JAZZ:** “Guess it didn’t.”

she kneels beside one: a woman with dried tears streaked through the dust on her cheeks, headset still glowing faint blue.  
Jazz’s reflection stares back in the visor — her own eyes haloed by the dying light.

for a moment she almost reaches out to disconnect the woman.  
then she stops.  
because what if that’s mercy? or murder?

> **JAZZ (quiet):** “Maybe this is faith too.”

Zadie watches her, unsettled.  
he doesn’t answer.  
they back out slowly.  
door creaks shut, hum fades.

cut to the car again — nothing said for miles.  
the weight of it rides with them.
