Perfect—this gives Evander his _first real friction point_ with the others: he’s not malevolent, he’s just too far removed to realize how callous he sounds. Lyra, who’s defined by empathy and the preservation of connection, becomes the perfect foil.

Here’s a **2½–3 page screenplay scene** you could place in Episode 4. It can work as a quiet interlude between heavier human sequences—something that shows the emotional rift forming within the pantheon.

### **INT. OBSERVATORY RUINS – NIGHT**

Moonlight seeps through the fractured dome, scattering across silver dust and half-dead instruments.  
**EVANDER** sits cross-legged atop a broken telescope, eyes closed, hands resting on his knees. He looks almost translucent in the dim light—like the air itself decided to imitate a man.

Footsteps echo from the stairwell. **LYRA** climbs into the room, breath visible in the cold. She pauses, watching him.

**LYRA**  
You heard what Lucian told me.

Evander doesn’t move.

**LYRA (CONT'D)**  
You always hear everything. You just pretend you don’t.

**EVANDER**  
Pretending implies effort.

She rolls her eyes, folds her arms.

**LYRA**  
He’s unraveling, Evander.  
He says the Architect’s silence isn’t peace anymore—it’s neglect.  
And you sit here acting like it’s all part of the plan.

Evander opens his eyes. Calm. Weightless.

**EVANDER**  
Maybe it is. Maybe chaos is the plan finally working.

**LYRA**  
You don’t believe that.

**EVANDER**  
Belief’s a mortal habit. I’m cured.

Lyra steps closer, anger creeping into her voice.

**LYRA**  
You call that cured? You’ve vanished into yourself.  
Lucian’s breaking, Val’s losing control, and you’re sitting here pretending detachment is wisdom.

**EVANDER**  
Maybe wisdom _is_ the refusal to keep bleeding for the same world.  
Maybe compassion means letting it find its own end.

**LYRA**  
You sound just like him—the Architect—when he walked away from us.

A crack finally shows in Evander’s stillness. He looks up; the name lands heavier than he expected.

**EVANDER**  
Don’t compare me to him.

**LYRA**  
Then stop acting like nothing matters.  
We’re family, Evander.  
_(beat)_  
And you act like we’re already ghosts.

Evander stands, dust falling from his coat. His tone stays soft, but something defensive flickers beneath it.

**EVANDER**  
Maybe that’s the only way to survive forever—accept that we already are.

Lyra stares at him, disbelief giving way to sorrow.

**LYRA**  
You know what’s worse than dying?  
Watching someone you love decide they’re done living.

She turns to leave.  
Evander starts to say something, but stops.  
The observatory creaks around them—metal sighing like old breath.

Lyra pauses at the door.

**LYRA (CONT'D)**  
When you finally feel something again…  
Don’t wait too long to tell someone.

She disappears down the stairs.

Evander stands alone. The wind slips through the broken glass, brushing his face. For the first time in ages, his eyes close—not in meditation, but in exhaustion.

### **Tone & Purpose**

- **Evander’s flaw manifests**: intellectual detachment mistaken for serenity.
    
- **Lyra humanizes the pantheon**; her confrontation re-anchors the emotional stakes.
    
- The line _“Maybe wisdom is the refusal to keep bleeding for the same world”_ crystallizes his rationale, while _“You act like we’re already ghosts”_ punctures it.
    
- It sets up a later reversal—when Evander is finally forced to _feel_ again, this exchange will echo back as the moment he was warned.

Would you like me to extend this just slightly—add a short coda of Evander alone afterward (a visual beat showing the first crack in his composure, maybe hearing Lyra’s voice echo in memory)?
