**INT. SHATTERED HALL – NIGHT**

Lucian and Kaelarys stand in ruins of their argument — voices hoarse from shouting, eyes blazing.

**KAELARYS**  
(snarling through tears)  
You’ve destroyed everything. Everything we are!

**LUCIAN**  
(voice breaking, stepping closer)  
Kaelarys… please know that I love you. You have always been a rock for us.

She trembles, on the edge of collapse.

**LUCIAN (cont’d)**  
But I can’t just sit idly while this unfolds.

He pulls her into an embrace. She resists for half a second, then melts into it.

She squeezes tighter, eyes closed, savoring it as if it might be the last time.

**KAELARYS**  
(whisper, almost to herself)  
Then don’t let go.

Lucian’s jaw clenches — but slowly, painfully, he releases her.

Kaelarys watches him walk away, the weight of that fleeting embrace heavier than any argument.
