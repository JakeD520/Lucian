## **INT. RE-EMERGENCE CENTER – NIGHT**

Soft amber light. Walls painted warm, not white. Machines hum — not VR pods but medical ones: monitors tracking blood pressure, hydration, muscle tone.  
Rows of beds, patients at different stages of “re-embodiment.”  
A gentle _metronome click_ echoes through the hall — therapists use rhythm to retrain temporal awareness.

Maya sits upright in her cot.  
Her hair is uneven, skin paper-thin, eyes darting at every sound.  
A nurse helps her adjust a breathing strip across her chest.

**NURSE**  
_(quiet)_  
Focus on the inhale. Air in, not data.

Maya nods, shivering. Across from her, **Marcus** is strapped to a standing frame — his first time vertical in months.  
He sweats, trembling. Electrodes trace his spine.

**MARCUS**  
My legs feel… _buffering._

**THERAPIST**  
That’s good. That means they’re remembering.

Maya manages a weak laugh; he grins back.  
Tiny flicker of who they were.

### **INT. RE-EMERGENCE CENTER – CAFETERIA – DAY**

They sit at a table with others.  
A tray of real food between them — oatmeal, fruit, water.  
The smell alone overwhelms them.

**MAYA**  
It’s too loud.

**MARCUS**  
It’s just chewing.

She closes her eyes, tears starting.  
He reaches across the table; their fingers brush — a small electric shock of _contact._  
Their first unfiltered touch in over a year.

**MAYA**  
That… feels different.

**MARCUS**  
Yeah. It’s lag-free.

They laugh until they cough.

### **INT. RE-EMERGENCE CENTER – GROUP ROOM – WEEKS LATER**

A community circle. Paper notebooks, not tablets.  
A counselor projects a muted feed on the wall — **Lucian’s speech** replaying from the symposium.  
Everyone watches, silent.

> **LUCIAN (on screen)**  
> “You are not machine minds in machine bodies.  
> You are light wearing skin.”

The room reacts — some cry, some smile.  
Maya’s hand tightens on Marcus’s.

**MAYA**  
He’s right.  
_(beat)_  
We were never supposed to _stay_ there.

**MARCUS**  
Then maybe this—_(he gestures around the room)_—is what coming home looks like.

The counselor switches off the feed. The sudden quiet is heavy but not empty.

### **EXT. RE-EMERGENCE CENTER – MORNING**

Weeks later. They step outside for the first time unassisted.  
The city is normal — commuters, neon ads, kids with haptic bands.  
Maya squints at real sunlight; Marcus shields his eyes.

**MARCUS**  
Still feels like a sim.

**MAYA**  
Then let’s keep testing it.

She takes his hand. They walk slowly toward a nearby park.  
Behind them, the center glows warm against the cold architecture — a small, living heart in a mechanized body.

### **CUT TO**

**INT. NEWS STUDIO – SAME TIME**

A commentator replays Lucian’s speech.  
Subtitles scroll: _THE SPARK MOVEMENT GAINS MOMENTUM._  
Behind the anchor, headlines:  
_GOVERNMENTS INVESTIGATE VR DEPENDENCY_  
_IMMERSION GIANTS FACE BACKLASH._

Hope in the air. A world that still works — for now.

### **BACK TO: MAYA AND MARCUS**

They reach the park bench, sit, breathing hard but smiling.  
Around them, the city hums — real, flawed, alive.

**MAYA**  
You think they’ll ever all come back?

**MARCUS**  
Maybe they won’t have to. Maybe it’s enough that _we did._


Maya watches a group walking nearby.
Marcus follows her gaze but says nothing.  
They sit in the light — two people relearning how to exist.

**FADE OUT.**
