**INT. FAMILY HALL – NIGHT**

Lucian and Kaelarys stand apart, tension thick.

**KAELARYS**  
Lucian… just come home.

Lucian freezes. His eyes soften. For a moment, he’s not the prophet, not the rebel — he’s her brother again. He wants it. He _aches_ for it.

Silence. His jaw trembles.

Finally, he shakes his head — barely.

**LUCIAN**  
I can’t.

Kaelarys’ eyes glisten. She turns away before he sees the tear.

Lucian watches her go, fists clenched, haunted.
