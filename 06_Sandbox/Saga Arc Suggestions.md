# **Saga Character + Theme Report**

_(based on our development so far)_

---

## **Core Theme**

- The gods are _orphans,_ abandoned by their Architect.
    
- Their foundation — Lucian, the First Light, perceived closest to the Architect — fractures when he rebels to become his own creator.
    
- With humanity fading into extinction, the siblings lose worship, lose Pattern, and are left with only each other.
    
- **The heart of the saga:** _When divinity fails, family is what remains._
    
- **Final Contrast:**
    
    - The family: reconciled, creating together.
        
    - Lucian: alone, creating for the first time, whispering “Let there be light.”

## **Character Arcs**

### **Lucian (First Light / Rebel / Composer)**

- **Start:** The foundation of the family. Closest to the Architect, burdened with expectation.
    
- **Arc:** Rebellion → exile → unraveling → self-authorship.
    
- **Key Beat:** Betrays family by leaving, drawing Lyra and Rexus into fracture.
    
- **End:** Alone in void, losing everything (even himself). First act of creation: _“Let there be light.”_

### **Aella (Irreverent / Sardonic / Angry Sister)**

- **Start:** Sardonic, irreverent, Natasha Lyonne energy. Close to Rexus and Lyra. Jokes about butter at the diner.
    
- **Arc:** Moves from irreverence → anger → scorn at Lucian’s betrayal.
    
- **Key Beat:** Scathing confrontation with Lucian — flicks cigarette, slaps him, “Fuck you.” Walks away cold.
    
- **Mid Arc:** Pushes Lyra harder toward her Beelzebub turn by trying to “save” her.
    
- **End:** Tearful moment with Lyra on her return: _“I just know I liked it better when you were around.”_
    
- **Function:** The family’s raw nerve — cuts through with mockery, hides her own sadness.

### **Zadie (Casual Hedonist / Hank Moody energy)**

- **Start:** Detached, sardonic, befriends humans (Artie). Doesn’t take stakes seriously.
    
- **Arc:** Refuses to mourn, chooses indulgence: _“If the party’s ending, enjoy it while it lasts.”_
    
- **Key Beat:** Clash with Rexus — “Lila deserves to see her daughter grow old.” Zadie: “You can’t change it. Cherish it while it’s here.”
    
- **End:** Doesn’t arc dramatically — remains static, but well-rounded. Serves as counterweight to the others’ intensity.
    
- **Function:** Comic relief and existential foil.

### **Val (Performer / Addict / Recovering Hedonist)**

- **Start:** Charismatic, adored, morphing beauty (Alexander Ludwig / Vanessa Kirby). Lives off human worship. Loved by siblings but addicted to validation.
    
- **Arc:** Worship high → collapse → Fat Thor phase (slovenly, sweats, chips) → recovery with family → authentic reintegration.
    
- **Key Beat:** Nightclub pantomime scene — dances in silence, invisible partner, empty booth.
    
- **Key Beat:** Rock bottom — Aella or Rexus finds them in sweats, Val at their lowest.
    
- **Key Beat:** Recovery scene with Evander — both admit they’re in new territory, learning together.
    
- **End:** Around the family, Val speaks genuine philosophy, is teased (“What did you do to Val?”). CU: Val truly happy, seen with love instead of worship.
    
- **Function:** The most “human” god arc — addiction, collapse, recovery, reintegration.

### **Jazz (Void Wanderer / Social Misfit / Clarity without Decorum)**

- **Start:** Absent in S1, returns in S2 as odd sibling who lived in the Void. Sardonic Emily Hampshire energy.
    
- **Arc:** From detached observer → awkward misfit → remembering connection → reintegration.
    
- **Key Beat:** Weird tangents in conversation (Kosher → Nazis → Sanskrit). Family: “…okay, Jazz.”
    
- **Key Beat:** Lyra recalls Atlantis memory, cracks Jazz’s detachment: _“Damn… I forgot this part of me. I forgot us.”_
    
- **End:** Softened, reintegrated. Still weird, but present.
    
- **Function:** Mirror for Val — she’s always been inward, he learns to go inward. Both arcs converge into belonging.
    

---

### **Evander (Fool-Philosopher / Ripple-Maker / Contradictory Anchor)**

- **Start:** Alan Watts in plushies. Naked, smoking, philosophizing Tom & Jerry. Speaks in riddles, contradictions, stories.
    
- **Arc:** Doesn’t “arc” like others — wobbles but always re-centers. His gift is stability through contradiction.
    
- **Key Beat:** In argument, Aella demands clarity; for once, Evander stalls, speechless. Val steps in to support.
    
- **Key Beat:** Later, Evander and Val connect — both admit they’re in new territory, both worried about unknown.
    
- **End:** Still contradictory, still rippling, but grounded as part of family.
    
- **Function:** The ripple-maker. Not a teacher, but one who destabilizes rigidity so others discover meaning themselves.

### **Rexus (Steward / Chaos with Compassion)**

_(You hinted but we didn’t dig deeply in this thread — but based on earlier notes)_

- **Start:** Chaotic, loved by all, but secretly anchored by care for humanity.
    
- **Arc:** Devastated by human extinction, clashes with Zadie.
    
- **Function:** Emotional core — his love for mortals makes the apocalypse sting.
    

---

### **Kaelarys (Apathetic Caretaker / Put-it-Back-Together Sister)**

_(Also touched earlier)_

- **Start:** Apathetic about humanity, but protective of siblings.
    
- **Arc:** Moves from detachment → burden of trying to “fix” family fractures.
    
- **Function:** Quiet backbone.

- **Final Lucian Scene (Series Close):** Alone, stripped. Whispers: _“Let there be light.”_ Spark blooms. FADE TO WHITE.
