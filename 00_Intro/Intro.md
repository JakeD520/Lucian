## **CRYSTAL GARDEN — TITLE SEQUENCE (Eden Corrupted Version)**

_(Young Fathers – “Promised Land,” 60–70 s cut)_

---

### **0 :00 – 0 :20 | “I’m heading to the land / They call the Promised Land”**

**Audio:** nearly a cappella; slow BPM; just breath, room noise, and that trembling falsetto.  
**Visual:**

- Fade up on **a hyper-real Eden**: golden light through translucent leaves, water moving in slow motion, air thick with floating pollen.
    
- The color grading is immaculate — _too_ clean. No insects, no shadow noise.
    
- Camera glides forward through this perfection; reflections are a beat too perfect, depth of field too sharp.
    
- On _“Promised Land”_, a brief lens flare flicks the edge of frame — almost a digital blink.
    

_Emotion:_ reverent awe, beauty that already feels uncanny.

### **0 :20 – 0 :35 | “Brother, sister, I won’t have it”**

**Audio:** the beat enters; low synth rumble beneath the vocal.  
**Visual:**

- The camera drifts past the first **imperfection**: a flower looping the same unfurl animation, a leaf edge aliasing under light.
    
- In the lake reflection, the horizon flickers a frame late.
    
- A soft **render pop** with the first drum hit — a missing texture pulse.
    
- Color temperature drifts cooler; that sacred warmth begins to desaturate.
    

_Emotion:_ disbelief edging into dread.

### **0 :35 – 0 :48 | “I’m saving fifty men / I’m treading, sinking still” (revised)**

**Audio:** percussion thickens; distortion creeping in.  
**Visual:**

- Subtle Z-fighting shimmer along stone edges; grass tiles duplicate, snapping back.
    
- The camera passes an  Adam-and-Eve-like pair frozen mid-motion; polygons beneath their skin stutter.
    
- **A single red apple** rests in the foreground — its surface too perfect, specular highlights looping.
    
- On the _record-scratch scream_, the apple **tears into bloom of white**, the frame blows out, geometry disintegrates.
    
- One-frame flash of nothingness before the scene rebuilds with harsher light.
    

_Emotion:_ the lie revealed; paradise collapses the instant perfection is touched.

---

### **0 :48 – 1 :02 | “So much for the Promised Land / Don’t go down with me”**

**Audio:** gospel choir explodes; distortion and static bloom.  
**Visual:**

- The garden collapses in waves of **render loss** — exposure oscillates, depth-of-field algorithm freaks, chromatic aberration halos everything.
    
- Geometry decimates into wireframe shards that hang like glass dust.
    
- Every “Don’t go” triggers a shutter-like freeze, motion resuming a half-beat late.

_Emotion:_ revelation; holiness was compression artifact.

---

### **1 :02 – 1 :10 | “Headed to the Promised Land” (outro)**

**Audio:** mix thins; only falsetto and shephards tone. 
**Visual:**

- Whiteout resolves into faint silhouettes of the fallen garden now suspended in haze, geometry half-rebuilt.
    
- From that haze emerges text, refracted like through broken glass:  
    **C R Y S T A L G A R D E N S**
    
- The letters anti-alias themselves into focus, then dissolve into soft noise.
    

_Emotion:_ quiet after chaos — beauty reborn, imperfect but real.

### **Technical / Tone Guide**

- **Rendering style:** photoreal lighting with controlled digital artifacts (alias shimmer, texture banding, exposure stepping).
    
- **Color arc:** warm gold → cold teal → blinding white.
    
- **Camera:** one unbroken dolly forward; simulate dropped frames during corruption.
    
- **VFX cues:**
    
    - micro-alias crawl (after 0 :20)
        
    - reflection delay (0 :25)
        
    - single-frame full-white on scratch (0 :40)
        
    - exposure pump (0 :50 – 0 :55)
        
    - logo bloom + shephards tone + noise fade (1 :05 – 1 :10)
