## **INT. ANTIQUE SHOP — TREME, NEW ORLEANS — DAY**

A wide, locked frame holds the shop.

Morning light filters through the front windows, catching dust in the air.  
Shelves crowd the space with objects from different eras.

MAYA moves through frame, adjusting a stack of postcards. She straightens a picture frame, nudges it level.

The door opens.  
A bell rings.

ELI enters the same frame.

Maya glances up. A small nod.

Eli nods back. Drifts deeper into the shop, unhurried, eyes moving before his hands do.

Maya’s phone rings.

She checks the screen. Smiles.

She answers without leaving frame.

**MAYA**  
Hey, Grandma.

She continues moving, lifting an old clock, wiping dust from its base, setting it back exactly where it was.

**MAYA (CONT’D)**  
Yeah. I’m here.  
It’s quiet right now.

Eli remains in the background, browsing.

**MAYA (CONT’D)**  
No, I know.  
I locked up last night.

A beat. Maya smiles wider.

**MAYA (CONT’D)**  
I promise.  
Nothing’s going anywhere.

She listens.

**MAYA (CONT’D)**  
I love you too.

Maya ends the call. Slips the phone into her pocket.

She exhales softly.

Her eyes lift — and land on Eli.

He’s at a small display of pens now.

Same frame.

Eli picks one up. Turns it in his fingers. Sets it down.  
Then picks it up again.

Maya finishes straightening a nearby shelf.

She walks into the existing frame, stopping beside him.

They share the space.  
Profiled toward the display.

A beat.

**MAYA**  
They don’t make them like that anymore.

Eli nods, still turning the pen.

**ELI**  
Feels heavier.

**MAYA**  
Yeah.  
You’re supposed to feel it when you write.

Silence holds. The pen rests between them.

**ELI**  
People still do that?

Maya smiles slightly.

**MAYA**  
Some do.

Another pause.

**ELI**  
I do.  
Sometimes.

Maya doesn’t react beyond a nod.

**MAYA**  
What do you write?

Eli hesitates.

**ELI**  
Poetry.

He waits — for judgment, correction, anything.

None comes.

**MAYA**  
That’s nice.

She gestures gently toward the pen.

**MAYA (CONT’D)**  
That one’s from the ’40s.  
Still works.

**ELI**  
How much?

Maya tells him.

Eli exhales, half a laugh.

Maya considers him — not the pen.

**MAYA**  
I can do a little better.

Eli looks up, surprised.

**ELI**  
…Okay.

### AT THE COUNTER — SAME TWO-SHOT LOGIC

A locked two shot holds them both.

Maya rings him up.

Silence stretches.

Eli shifts.

**ELI**  
I could—  
I mean—  
I could read you something.  
If you want.

Maya meets his eyes.

**MAYA**  
I’d like that.

Eli recites a short poem.

Quiet. Unrushed.

The camera does not move.  
Maya listens in the same frame.

When he finishes, neither of them moves.

Maya takes the pen from the counter.

She steps around it — entering the frame, not pulling focus.

She places the pen directly into Eli’s hand.

Their fingers overlap briefly.

**MAYA**  
Thank you.

Eli smiles. Small. Real.

**ELI**  
Thank you.

He turns and exits frame.

The bell rings.

Maya remains.

The frame holds as the door settles.

The shop returns to stillness.

**CUT.**
