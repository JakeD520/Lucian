# EPISODE 4 — ENNEAGON GATHERING

## SINGLE CONTINUOUS SHOT MAP (BOOGIE NIGHTS DNA)

---

## SHOT DURATION

Approx. **4–5 minutes**  
Breathing room. No rush.

---

## START POSITION — “DISCOVERY”

**CAMERA POSITION:**  
Behind the **wine rack**, partially obscured by bottles.

We see:

- the bottoms of glass bottles
    
- firelight flickering through liquid
    
- reversed labels, distorted shapes
    

**ACTION:**  
A hand enters frame — **Evander**.

He slides one bottle out. Checks it. Slides it back.  
Another bottle. Pauses. Smirks.

He pulls it free.

**CAMERA FOLLOWS THE BOTTLE FORWARD** as Evander steps away —

—and the **room opens up**.

---

## ENTERING THE CHAOS

The Great Hall reveals itself **already alive**.

The camera doesn’t stop. It drifts with Evander.

**RIGHT OF FRAME:**  
Rexus passes, already mid-laugh.

Evander casually produces a second bottle — whiskey — and pours as he walks.

Without looking, he places the glass into Rexus’ hand.

Rexus keeps moving.

---

## FIRST ORBIT — ESTABLISH BEHAVIOR

The camera drifts past **Aella climbing onto Rexus’ back**, drink raised high.

She laughs too loudly.

**Zadie crosses frame**, lifting Rexus’ drink mid-stride.

Rexus reaches back instinctively — too late.

Zadie lights a cigarette while walking.

Aella leans down from Rexus’ back:

> “Gimme. Gimme.”

Zadie lights a second cigarette from the first and hands it up to her **without breaking stride**.

The camera doesn’t stop — it **witnesses and moves on**.

---

## EVANDER / LYRA CROSSOVER

Evander backs into frame again, dancing lightly with **Lyra** for a few steps.

He pours wine for someone off-camera while moving.

Lyra laughs, spins away, immediately re-enters another conversation.

The camera follows Lyra for half a beat —

—then drifts past her toward **Val**.

---

## VAL + LUCIAN (FIRST ATTEMPT)

Val lounges against a stone column, drink in hand.

Lucian is already there, mid-sentence.

Val pours Lucian a drink **while he’s talking**.

Listens just enough to catch tone.

Responds casually, eyes already scanning the room.

Val turns away mid-response:

> “Hey — Evander. Chardonnay?”

Lucian pauses. Smiles faintly.

The camera doesn’t linger. It moves.

---

## SECOND ORBIT — CHAOS BUILDS

The camera weaves through:

- Zadie flicking ash into an ancient goblet
    
- Aella upside-down off Rexus’ back, drinking
    
- Evander swapping bottles mid-pour
    
- Evander handing off glasses like muscle memory
    

Lucian reappears in frame, trying again — starting a thought while walking.

Someone crosses between him and the lens.

He’s obscured.

The camera doesn’t correct for it.

---

## KAELARYS ABSENCE BEAT (PASSING, NOT PAUSED)

Zadie appears near the camera, lighting another cigarette.

Casually:

> “Where the fuck is Kaelarys?”

The camera keeps moving.

Lyra, just passing through frame, answers lightly:

> “She’s working some things out.”

The room absorbs it instantly.

No stop.  
No weight.

The camera doesn’t mark it — but **Lyra’s half-beat registers** as she moves on.

---

## BUILD TO THE BREAK

Lucian attempts again — closer to center now.

He starts to speak.

Aella shouts something across the room.

Laughter erupts.

Lucian stops.

The camera stays with him **just long enough** to notice the shift — then drifts away.

---

## THE INTERRUPTION

**SOUND FIRST.**

A sharp **fist slam** echoes.

The camera is NOT on Lucian when it happens.

We see reactions ripple outward:

- heads turning
    
- movement slowing
    
- voices dipping
    

The camera pivots and **finds Lucian**.

Not elevated.  
Just suddenly visible.

---

## POST-BREAK ENERGY (NO HIERARCHY)

Immediate overlapping reactions:

- Aella calling him out
    
- Val laughing
    
- Zadie commenting
    
- Rexus reacting loudly
    

The camera moves _through_ reactions, never isolating one.

Lucian stays grounded. Slightly embarrassed.

---

## LYRA’S RESET

Lyra moves toward Lucian.

The camera follows **her movement**, not his status.

She doesn’t silence the room — she just draws proximity.

The volume drops naturally.

Lucian speaks.

This time, the camera **stays**.

---

## END POSITION — HELD BUT UNRESOLVED

Lucian finishes.

A beat.

The room doesn’t freeze.

Chaos resumes gently.

Val reacts with a sound or gesture.  
Zadie laughs.  
Evander moves back to the bottles.

Lyra remains near Lucian — watching.

The camera drifts backward, subtly returning toward the wine rack area —

—not hiding, just **withdrawing**.

---

## CUT.
