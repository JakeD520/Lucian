## CINEMATIC PASS

## (DISSOCIATION + SOCIAL PRESSURE)

### CORE RULE

> **The sound leads. Kai follows.**

The podcast is Kai’s buffer from the world.

---

### OPENING IMAGE

**CLOSE ON — KAI’S EARS**

Earbuds in.

A podcast voice bleeds in:

- fast
    
- optimistic
    
- confident
    

We don’t fully track content — just tone.

---

### KAI RIDING

Camera rides with him.  
Slightly behind.  
Slightly off-center.

Traffic noise muted beneath the podcast.

Kai’s face is neutral.  
Eyes forward.  
Elsewhere.

---

### RESTAURANT ENTRY

The podcast continues as Kai enters.

Inside sound bleeds in:

- voices
    
- kitchen noise
    
- overlapping calls
    

The podcast becomes harder to hear — but Kai doesn’t turn it off.

---

### WAITING

Kai stands off to the side.

The camera stays _just_ too close — reinforcing crowd pressure.

He shifts.  
Checks his phone.  
Pretends to read something.

Someone brushes past him.  
He recoils slightly.  
Avoids looking up.

---

### COUNTER MOMENT

The camera settles into a **two-shot-adjacent frame**:

- Kai in foreground
    
- counter employee mid-ground
    

She looks up.

Eye contact.

A beat longer than necessary.

She gives a small, friendly wave.

Kai hesitates — then mirrors it.

A tiny smile.  
Gone quickly.

The podcast keeps talking.  
Oblivious.

---

### INTERRUPTION

A man steps into frame suddenly.

“DoorDash?”

Kai flinches.  
Pulls one earbud out halfway.

“Huh?”

Beat.

“Oh. Yeah.”

---

### HANDOFF

The bag is placed into Kai’s hands.

Physical weight.  
Purpose restored.

The podcast volume rises again as he reseats the earbud.

---

### EXIT

Kai turns toward the door.

Pauses.  
Looks back.

The woman is already back to work.  
Focused.  
Gone.

Kai exits.

The door closes behind him.

The podcast continues — hyped, certain, forward-looking.

Kai unlocks his bike.

Rides off.
