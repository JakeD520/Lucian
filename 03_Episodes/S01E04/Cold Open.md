## **INT. STUDIO APARTMENT — MORNING**

The room is dim.  
Morning light slips in through a single window, thin and directional. It never fills the space.

Kai sits up on a mattress pushed against the wall.

He swings his legs down.

**CLOSE ON — HIS FEET**  
They plant on worn carpet.

Kai stands and crosses the apartment.

**TRACK WITH HIM — LOW**  
His feet move through the space without hesitation, stepping around scattered debris at the edges of frame. A flattened pizza box. Loose packaging. None of it slows him.

At the kitchenette, Kai opens an overhead cabinet.

Inside: crowded shelves. Mismatched items.

He reaches in and pulls out a box of cereal.

Milk from the fridge.  
A bowl.  
A spoon.

He pours.

The sound is clean in the quiet room.

Kai carries the bowl into the main living area.

### THE PC RIG

It dominates the space.

A wide desk pressed against the wall.  
Multiple monitors arranged in a shallow arc.  
A tower beneath, LEDs glowing faintly.  
Cables routed cleanly. Intentionally.

The **computer chair** is pulled back just enough.

There is no couch.  
No table.  
No other seating.

Kai lowers himself to the floor beside the desk.

He eats.

**HOLD.**

He leans back lightly against the side of the desk. Still. Settled.

Between bites, Kai turns the cereal box in his hands, reading the back.

A pause.

A small smile.

He sets the box down.

Pulls out his phone.

Scrolls.

A quiet laugh—brief, genuine.

Another bite.

**HOLD.**

The surrounding room stays dim.  
The rig remains the clearest shape in the frame.
