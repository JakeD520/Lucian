# EPISODE 4 — LUCiAN & LYRA

## GREAT HALL (AFTER)

### TREATMENT (SPINE ONLY)

---

## SCENE PURPOSE

Release tension from the Enneagon gathering.  
Deepen Lucian and Lyra’s intimacy through humor and quiet presence.  
Show Lyra as fully human in spirit — curious, awkward, playful.

---

## SETTING

**INT. GREAT HALL — LATER**

The room is mostly empty now.

Glasses left behind.  
Chairs slightly askew.  
Fire burned low.

The chaos has passed, but its residue remains.

---

## SEQUENCE FLOW

### 1. STILLNESS AFTER NOISE

Lucian stands alone near the table where he tried to speak earlier.

He’s quieter now.  
Not angry — just spent.

Lyra enters the space behind him.

She doesn’t announce herself.

---

### 2. LYRA CLOSES THE DISTANCE

She comes to stand beside him.

Not facing him.  
Facing the room.

They share the silence.

She speaks softly — about something small.  
Unrelated to the earlier tension.

Lucian listens.

---

### 3. REDIRECTION

Lyra gently steers the conversation away from responsibility.

She comments on something left behind:

- an empty glass
    
- a chair
    
- a jacket
    

Lucian responds — distracted at first, then present.

---

### 4. THE CIGARETTE BIT

Lyra notices Zadie’s pack of cigarettes on the table.

She picks it up. Examines it.

Lucian notices.

A look.

Lyra shrugs — curious.

She takes one out. Lights it.

Inhales.

Immediate regret.

She coughs. Grimaces.

> “Oh god. No. What the fuck.”

Lucian laughs — surprised by it.

Lyra turns to him.

> “Don’t laugh at me.”

She bumps him lightly.

Lucian’s laughter lingers.

---

### 5. SHIFT IN ENERGY

The mood lifts.

Not dramatically.  
Just enough.

They talk about something trivial.  
Something human.

Lucian smiles without trying to stop it.

---

### 6. CLOSING BEAT

Lyra leans against the table.

Lucian stays near.

They look at each other.

Comfortable.

No declarations.  
No vows.

Just being there — after.

---

## END STATE

Lucian is lighter than when the scene began.  
Lyra is clearly not a symbol, not a muse — just a person who stayed.  
The episode breathes.
