# EPISODE 4 — END GAME

## “MAYBE TOMORROW”

### TREATMENT (END SEQUENCE / MUSIC-LED)

---

## CORE INTENT

Close the episode on **interpersonal possibility**, not resolution.  
Let hope exist as _orientation_, not outcome.  
End on connection that hasn’t happened yet — but feels reachable.

---

## MUSICAL FRAME

**Stereophonics – “Maybe Tomorrow”**  
Song comes in early and carries us through the final movements.

No needle-drop punctuation.  
It _breathes over_ the scenes.

---

## STRUCTURE

A **soft intercut sequence**, no urgency, no escalation.  
Each beat mirrors the others emotionally, not narratively.

---

## BEAT 1 — ARIS & SARA (TRYING ANYWAY)

**INT. BAR / HAPPY HOUR SPOT — EARLY EVENING**

Low-key. Casual. Not celebratory.

Aris and Sara sit with drinks.

Not talking shop.

A small laugh lands.  
A shared look.

Sara lifts her glass slightly.

Aris nods.

No big speech.  
Just:

> _“We keep going.”_

They clink glasses — quietly.

---

## BEAT 2 — LUCIAN & LYRA (BEING MET)

**INT. GREAT HALL — LATER**

Fire burned low.

Lucian speaks — not about plans, not about outcomes.

Just worry.

Lyra listens.

She doesn’t solve it.  
She doesn’t counter it.

She stays.

A touch.  
A shared smile.

Lucian exhales — the weight doesn’t disappear, but it’s shared now.

---

## BEAT 3 — KAI (ALMOST)

**EXT. RESTAURANT — NIGHT**

Kai rides past the same place.

Slows.

The counter employee is there again.

She looks up.

They lock eyes.

A beat longer this time.

Kai smiles.

She smiles back.

Kai’s phone pings — DoorDash.

He looks at the phone.  
Then back at her.

Not frustration.  
Acceptance.

He mounts the bike.

Rides on.

The smile lingers.

---

## BEAT 4 — MARCUS (OPENNESS)

**EXT. TREME — NIGHT**

Marcus walks.

No destination.

Street sounds. Music drifting from somewhere nearby.

He takes it in — the texture, the life, the history.

He slows near the antique shop.

---

## BEAT 5 — MAYA (SERENDIPITY)

**EXT. ANTIQUE SHOP — CONTINUOUS**

Maya locks up.

Turns.

Sees Marcus.

Marcus clocks her at the same time.

A pause.

Recognition without history.

Maya smiles.

Marcus smiles back.

Neither rushes.

They step toward each other — casually.

The song swells slightly.

---

## FINAL IMAGE

They’re still a few steps apart.

Not touching.  
Not speaking.

Just possibility.

---

## END STATE

No problems solved.  
No destinies declared.

Just people noticing each other.

**Maybe tomorrow.**
