### 1. ARRIVAL INTO CHAOS

The scene begins already in motion.

The Enneagon occupy the hall in loose clusters:

- drinks passing hands
    
- bodies colliding and separating
    
- laughter overlapping conversations
    

No single focal point.  
The room operates as one organism.

---

### 2. CAMERA MOVEMENT (TREATMENT LEVEL)

The camera moves through the space continuously:

- passing close to faces
    
- catching fragments of conversations
    
- drifting between small moments
    

No hierarchy in framing.  
Everyone is equal in the frame.

---

### 3. LUCian ATTEMPTS TO SPEAK (FAILED STARTS)

Lucian tries to enter the flow.

He begins to speak — twice, maybe three times.

Each attempt is interrupted:

- a sibling stealing a drink
    
- someone talking over him
    
- a joke landing at the wrong moment
    

No malice.  
No resistance.  
Just momentum.

Lucian does not assert control.

---

### 4. SIBLING TEASING

The group notices Lucian’s seriousness.

Light teasing:

- comments about his tone
    
- jokes about humans being chaotic
    
- playful exaggeration of his concern
    

The teasing diffuses focus rather than escalating conflict.

---

### 5. ABSENCE BEAT — KAELARYS

Mid-chaos, someone casually asks where Kaelarys is.

The question passes through the room lightly.

Lyra answers briefly.  
The group accepts it and moves on.

The moment is small.  
The scene does not pause for it.

---

### 6. FRUSTRATION BREAK

Lucian’s composure slips.

A small physical gesture:

- a fist to the table
    
- a sharp sound
    

The room reacts — surprised, not fearful.

Energy shifts, but authority does not.

---

### 7. REASSERTION OF EQUALITY

Immediate responses:

- teasing
    
- jokes
    
- commentary on Lucian’s seriousness
    

No one defers to him.  
No one follows his lead.

The family dynamic holds.

---

### 8. LYRA INTERVENES

Lyra steps in calmly.

She doesn’t command silence.  
She redirects attention.

Her presence alters the room’s rhythm.

The chaos softens but doesn’t disappear.

---

### 9. LUCian SPEAKS

Lucian finally speaks without interruption.

He states a concern about humanity:

- something has shifted
    
- something unfamiliar is happening
    

He does not explain fully.  
He does not persuade.

He simply places the thought into the room.

---

### 10. RELEASE

The moment does not resolve cleanly.

Some siblings react.  
Some deflect.  
Some absorb nothing.

The room gradually returns to motion.

Lyra remains attentive to Lucian as the chaos resumes.

---

## END STATE

The Enneagon remain united physically but misaligned emotionally.

Lucian has been heard — but not fully met.

The episode pivots from playful immortality toward unease.
