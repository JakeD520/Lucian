# EPISODE 4 — ARIS & SARA

## SYNAPSE HQ — STEERING MEETING

### TREATMENT (SPINE ONLY)

---

## SCENE PURPOSE

Advance the Synapse storyline without villainizing leadership.  
Establish Elise as empathetic, thoughtful, and wrong.  
Deepen Aris and Sara’s isolation by showing their concerns acknowledged but overridden.

---

## SETTING

**INT. SYNAPSE HQ — CONFERENCE ROOM — DAY**

Clean. Bright. Modern.

Glass walls.  
Screens dormant.  
A space built for decisions.

---

## SEQUENCE FLOW

### 1. ELISE ENTERS

Elise enters the room carrying coffee.

She looks tired — but functional.

She greets Aris and Sara warmly.

Light humor.  
A small attempt at levity.

Sara almost responds.  
Aris doesn’t.

Elise registers the shift immediately.

---

### 2. THE DATA

Aris and Sara present what they’ve found.

Not theatrically.  
Methodically.

Patterns:

- increased immersion duration
    
- emotional flattening
    
- withdrawal behaviors
    

The data speaks for itself.

Elise listens closely.

She doesn’t interrupt.  
She asks a clarifying question or two.

She is engaged.

---

### 3. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

When they finish, Elise takes a moment.

She acknowledges the work.

Thanks them.

Names the findings as disturbing.

This matters to her.

Sara exhales — tension releasing slightly.

---

### 4. EMPATHY

Elise shares her own unease.

Briefly.

She admits she’s questioned the pace of the rollout.

This is not performative.

It’s real.

For a moment, Aris believes they’ve reached her.

---

### 5. THE TURN

Elise reframes the situation.

She speaks about:

- cultural momentum
    
- digital migration already underway
    
- the responsibility to shape, not stop
    

Her argument is coherent.

She believes it.

She is not dismissive.

---

### 6. FINAL PUSH

Sara tries once more.

Simpler now.  
More personal.

Elise steps closer.

Her voice lowers.

She reassures without conceding.

Proposes monitoring.  
Caution within continuation.

She physically grounds the moment — a hand on Sara’s shoulder.

Supportive.  
Decisive.

---

### 7. END BEAT

Elise exits the meeting confident.

Aris and Sara remain.

They exchange a look.

Nothing needs to be said.

They’ve been heard.  
They’ve been trusted.  
They’ve been overruled.

---

## END STATE

No antagonists created.  
No conspiracy revealed.

Just a sincere divergence of belief.

The launch continues.
