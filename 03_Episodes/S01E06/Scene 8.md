### **SCENE 8 – BÄRENMÜHLDURCHGANG / EARLY EVENING**

**EXT. OPERNGASSE CROSSING – CONTINUOUS**

Kaelarys reaches the curb.  The light changes.  
She scurries across the street. Too quickly, but still a bit embarrassed from her earlier traffic instance.

She enters the underpass walkway.

**INT. BÄRENMÜHLDURCHGANG – CONTINUOUS**

The space is tighter.  
Ceiling low, walls dense with graffiti and small shop windows—postcards, cigarettes, knockoff bags glowing under flickering tubes.  
Voices bounce down the tunnel, overlapping languages turning to texture.

Kaelarys moves slower now, careful in the crowd.  
The camera stays close—shoulder level, following her through the narrow light.

A **woman with a small dog** approaches from the other direction.  
As they pass, the dog turns sharply toward Kaelarys, tail wagging, a happy low bark.  
She stops, surprised but calm, and kneels slightly, hand extended.  
The dog noses her fingers, presses against her palm.

Her expression opens—unfiltered warmth, the first real smile in a while.

**WOMAN (Austrian)**Proud of her pet's friendliness   
(He's riendly.)
Er ist freundlich!

Kaelarys scratches the dogs neck.  The dog responds happily.

**KAELARYS (Austrian)** (affectionately)
(He's beautiful.)
Er ist schön.

The woman chuckles, tugging the leash gently.

**WOMAN (Austrian)**  
(Let's go, Sam.)
Komm, Sam.

Kaelarys straightens, watching them fade into the flow.  
The smile remains a moment, then softens into something quieter—thoughtful, almost fragile.  
She continues through the passage; the camera stays tight on her, the walls scrolling by in waves of color.
