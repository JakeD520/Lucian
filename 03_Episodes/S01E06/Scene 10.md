### **SCENE 10 – NASCHMARKT / CAFE TABLE – EVENING**

**EXT. NASCHMARKT CAFÉ – GOLDEN HOUR**

Kaelarys sits at a small outdoor table.  
The crowd hums around her — soft laughter, the clink of dishes, a busker strumming somewhere nearby.  
She sets down a paper bag from the market, opens it carefully, takes a piece of fruit.

Her gaze drifts — people weaving between stalls, couples talking, the low orange sun catching every glass edge.

A **little girl**, about eleven, pauses near her table.  
Dark curls, bright eyes, clutching a paper cone of roasted nuts.  
She stares unabashedly.

> **MÄDCHEN**  
> Ich mag dein Kleid.  
> _(I like your dress.)_

Kaelarys looks up, surprised, then smiles — the kind that feels involuntary, soft.

> **KAELARYS**  
> Danke. Ich mag deins auch.  
> _(Thank you. I like yours too.)_

The girl beams, rocking on her heels.

> **MÄDCHEN**  
> Du siehst aus wie ein Model. Bist du eins?  
> _(You look like a model. Are you one?)_

Kaelarys laughs lightly, shaking her head.

> **KAELARYS**  
> Nein… aber danke.  
> _(No… but thank you.)_

The girl nods seriously, as if filing that away.

> **MÄDCHEN**  
> Was ist dein Beruf?  
> _(What’s your job?)_

Kaelarys hesitates.  
Her eyes drop to the fruit in her hand.  
When she looks back up, the smile is polite, distant.

> **KAELARYS**  
> Mein Job ist langweilig.  
> _(My job is boring.)_

The girl wrinkles her nose, thinking.

> **MÄDCHEN**  
> Hm… Ich weiß nicht, was ich werden will, wenn ich groß bin.  
> Vielleicht Lehrerin.  
> _(Hmm… I don’t know what I want to be when I grow up. Maybe a teacher.)_
> 
> **(proudly)**  
> Mein Papa ist Lehrer!  
> _(My daddy’s a teacher!)_

Kaelarys’ smile flickers — a small pause, a tremor behind the eyes.  
She recovers quickly, voice light but careful.

> **KAELARYS**  
> Das klingt wunderbar. Eine sehr gute Wahl.  
> _(That sounds wonderful. A very good choice.)_

A **male voice** calls from off-screen — the father.

> **VATER (O.S.)**  
> Lilli! Komm, wir müssen gehen!  
> _(Lilli! Come on, we have to go!)_

> **MÄDCHEN**  
> Tschüss!  
> _(Bye!)_

She runs off, coat flaring.  
Kaelarys watches her go — the small body folding into the crowd, hand slipping into her father’s.

Kaelarys’ smile fades slowly.  
The paper bag sits forgotten on the table.

A busker’s melody drifts in again — faint, a few missed notes, tender in its imperfection.  
Kaelarys looks down, then up again — her reflection caught faintly in the café window beside the words _“Naschmarkt Café”_ painted in gold.

**HOLD** — the smile gone, only stillness left.
