### **SCENE 9 – NASCHMARKT / EARLY EVENING**

**EXT. NASCHMARKT – CONTINUOUS**

Kaelarys steps out of the dim underpass into sudden light and motion.  
The **Naschmarkt** stretches before her — stalls glowing under canvas awnings, the air thick with spices, sizzling food, and voices layered in half a dozen languages.  
She pauses at the threshold for a beat, letting it wash over her.

The camera tracks beside her as she walks slowly between stalls.  
The **noise** here is alive but gentle — laughter, bargaining, the clink of glass jars, knives on cutting boards.  
Color everywhere — oranges, olives, baklava shining in trays of syrup.

She stops at a fruit stand.  
A **vendor** offers a slice of melon with a practiced grin.  
She accepts, takes a small bite.  
The sweetness catches her off guard; she laughs softly, nodding approval.

> **VENDOR (Austrian)**  
> Gut, ja?

She nods, smiling.  
He offers another piece; she waves him off politely, gestures to buy instead.  
Coins exchange hands — the first physical transaction we’ve seen her make.  
He wraps the fruit, drops it into a small paper bag.

Kaelarys thanks him — the sound of her voice warm, grounded.  
As she walks away, she catches snippets of other lives:  
— A couple arguing softly over flowers.  
— A group of students toasting tiny cups of coffee.  
— An older woman laughing with a fishmonger.

Kaelarys absorbs it all, moving slowly through the golden maze.  
She’s neither apart from nor a part of it — just _with_ it.

At one stall, she pauses again, tracing a line of **colorful scarves** fluttering in the breeze.  
The vendor grins.

> **VENDOR (Austrian, teasing)**  
> For you, goddess price.

She laughs — genuinely, briefly — shaking her head.

She continues deeper into the market, the hum softening as the stalls thin.  
Evening light hits the awnings, turning them to fire.  
Her silhouette moves through them — unhurried, calm.
