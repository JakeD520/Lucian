### **EPISODE 6 — “FIGURES” (opening draft)**

**INT. KARLSKIRCHE – VIENNA – AFTERNOON**

Ambient city noise fades as the heavy doors close behind the new visitors.  
The camera drifts with them: scattered tourists, a low choir rehearsal echoing from the dome.

Near the entry font, a **man dips his fingers into holy water**, touches forehead, chest, shoulders.  
Behind him, a **family** links hands in silent prayer before the altar.  
The sound is distant but textured — whispers, shoes on stone, the faint creak of pews.

**KAELARYS** moves through them slowly, her steps barely audible.  
She watches everything: the ritual gestures, the bowed heads, the small private hopes being released into air.  
No judgment — just absorption, as though cataloguing something familiar she no longer practices.

She stops at a fresco, studying brush strokes, the movement of painted wings across plaster.  
A **tourist** sidesteps, bumping her shoulder.

> **TOURIST (German, apologetic)**  
> Entschuldigung!

Kaelarys turns, soft smile.

> **KAELARYS (in German)**  
> Kein Problem.

The tourist returns a small **palms-together prayer bow.**

> **TOURIST**  
> Gott segne Sie.

She nods — smile holding for a beat too long, then slipping away as she turns back to the painting.  
The choir swells under the arch above, the melody almost—_Figures_—fragile, unresolving.

She looks up once more, eyes tracing the painted ascent toward heaven.  
Her face stays neutral; the emotion is in the stillness, in what she _doesn’t_ feel.

**CUT TO:**  
Her profile framed against gold light pouring from the dome windows.  
The chorus fades into tourist chatter.  
Kaelarys blinks once, grounding herself, and moves deeper into the church crowd — unseen, unremarked, an eternal being among believers.

**FADE OUT.**
