### **SCENE 5 – KÄRNTNERTORPASSAGE / LATE AFTERNOON**

**EXT. KÄRNTNERTORPASSAGE – CONTINUOUS**

Camera follows Kaelarys emerging from a shaded street into the wide pedestrian corridor.  
The light here is different — reflections off glass, bright clothing, the flicker of passing trams at the edges.  
Crowds flow in intersecting lines, hundreds of small stories crossing.

The sound returns slowly — shoes on tile, snatches of language, laughter, a phone ringing, someone calling for a friend.  
The score is almost nothing: just air and movement.

Kaelarys stops midstream.  
People move around her without noticing, a still point inside the living mosaic.  
The camera widens; she’s framed by motion — color and form weaving in and out of focus like brush strokes.

**FOCUS PULL:**  
a **father and teenage son** a few meters ahead.  
The boy gestures sharply, shoulders tight.  
The father’s voice rises in German, frustration more than anger.  
We don’t need subtitles — tone tells everything.  
The boy points off down another path; the father shakes his head, jaw clenched.

They pause in stalemate.  
Around them, pedestrians keep flowing — the crowd swallowing and revealing them in flashes.  
Kaelarys watches, expression unreadable.

Then the father exhales hard, throws his hands up — _“Na gut!”_ — _Fine!_  
He turns away; the boy spins the opposite direction, stomping off, backpack swinging.

For a moment they walk in mirrored rhythm — one disappearing into sun, the other into shadow.

Kaelarys’ eyes follow both until they vanish.  
Her gaze drifts back to the crowd — the shifting colors, the tiny collisions, the endless separations and reunions.  
To her, it’s a painting in motion: imperfect, beautiful, painful.

**WIDE SHOT:**  
She steps forward again, rejoining the current.  
The camera tracks behind her, the crowd enveloping her as if she’s dissolving into the living artwork.

**FADE WITH SOUND:**  
the murmur of the crowd blending into a faint, wordless melody — human noise turning into score.
