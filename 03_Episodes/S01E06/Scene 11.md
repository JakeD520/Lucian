### **SCENE 11 – NASCHMARKT / WITTES COSTUME SHOP – NIGHTFALL**

**EXT. NASCHMARKT – CONTINUOUS**

Kaelarys stands slowly from the café table.  
The chair legs scrape softly against the stone — the sound sharp in the hush between street noises.

She gathers herself with care: wipes at her eyes once, smooths the front of her dress, breathes in.  
Her movements are graceful, but the focus is gone from them — like someone performing a routine they no longer believe in.

She lifts the small **paper bag** from the table, glances inside — half-eaten fruit glistening with juice — and crosses to a nearby bin.  
Drops it in.  
It lands with a soft thud.

For a beat she just stands there, palms resting lightly on the edge of the bin, staring down at nothing.

Then she looks up.

Across the street, warm light spills from the **Wittes Costume Shop** window.  
Tulle, sequins, children’s masks, cheap crowns, and plastic wings glow behind the glass.

She takes a step toward it, drawn by color and memory more than curiosity.

The camera shifts — following her approach in a slow, steady track.  
The street around her moves out of focus: a tram bell, the rustle of paper, a man laughing somewhere behind her — all falling away.

She stops in front of the glass.

Inside, the **angel costume** gleams under the yellow bulbs.  
Her reflection blends into the mannequin’s painted face, eyes shimmering as they merge.

Her lips part — no sound.  
Just breath.

A tear falls, catching the light before disappearing into the dark fabric of her dress.

She doesn’t move again.  
Only her reflection moves — distorted by passing headlights.
