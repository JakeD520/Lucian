### **SCENE 6 – TU VIENNA / STREET CROSSING**

**EXT. KARLSPLATZ – OUTSIDE TU VIENNA UNIVERSITY LIBRARY – LATE AFTERNOON**

Kaelarys crosses the broad intersection, sun lowering behind the buildings.  
The **corner statue**—a massive stone scholar holding a book—casts a long shadow across the pavement.

She stops in front of it.  
For a moment, the street noise dims: the hum of engines, faint echo of voices, the beat of her own breath.  
She studies the monument the way she studied the fresco earlier—absorbing its posture, its effort to capture knowledge in stone.

She steps back slowly, wanting to see it whole.  
Her eyes narrow against the light.

**HORN BLAST.**

She startles—turns—  
A car screeches to a near-stop just feet away.  
Her coat catches the wake of air.

She hops back onto the curb, one hand raised in reflex.

> **KAELARYS (Austrian, quick, polite)**  
> Entschuldigung!

She smiles—a soft, effortless thing—and gives a small wave of apology.  
The **driver**, middle-aged, starts to scold but falters; her smile disarms him.  
He exhales, nods, half-smiling back before driving off.

Kaelarys watches him go, a faint bemused look—half curiosity, half wonder at what just happened.  
She glances once more at the statue, then at the street she almost stepped into.

She adjusts her scarf, takes a slow breath, and continues down the sidewalk toward the **Secession Building**.

**CAMERA HOLDS:**  
the statue towering behind her, the light cooling to gold, the city alive around her.
