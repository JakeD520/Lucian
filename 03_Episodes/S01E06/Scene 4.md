### **SCENE 4 – MUTTER UND KIND / MID-AFTERNOON**

**EXT. RAINERSTRASSE – MID-AFTERNOON**

Kaelarys follows the slow curve of the street; traffic hums, a tram bell rings somewhere behind her.  
Between buildings, a small **courtyard garden** opens — quiet, half-hidden.  
In its center: **Mutter und Kind**, bronze dulled by weather, mother kneeling, child in her arms.

Kaelarys stops at the gate.  
The city sound thins — not silence, just distance.  
Leaves shift, a pigeon clatters off the statue’s shoulder.

She steps closer.  
The bronze catches stray light; rain has left dark streaks along the mother’s back, like old tears.  
A flower lies at the base, wilted.

Kaelarys’ breath trembles once.  
Her eyes travel from the child’s hand to the mother’s bowed head.  
She studies the curve of protection — the instinct she almost acted on earlier.  
For a moment, her own hand rises unconsciously, mirroring the mother’s gesture.  
Then she stops herself, fingers folding into a fist.

**CLOSE:** her reflection in the polished bronze — ghosted, incomplete.  
For a heartbeat, mother, child, and Kaelarys all share the same frame, frozen in one pulse of grief and reverence.

A car horn breaks the spell.  
She blinks, steps back.  
The world rushes in again — footsteps, wind, the tram bell repeating like a reminder to move.

Kaelarys turns away from the statue, eyes dry but unfocused, and continues down the path.
