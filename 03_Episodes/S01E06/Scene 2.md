### **SCENE 2 – KARLSPLATZ / EARLY AFTERNOON**

The square is alive — late sun, buskers, the rustle of people between trams and fountains.  
Kaelarys moves through it at an even pace, letting the crowd part around her.  
She’s silent, composed, a figure of balance amid chaos.

**Ahead**, a **toddler** stands alone near a kiosk, eyes wide.  
Not crying — just _searching._  
He turns one way, then another, small hands twisting in the hem of his coat.  
People drift past; nobody sees him.

Kaelarys’ gaze catches on him.  
Something sharp flickers across her expression — recognition, concern, maybe fear of the feeling itself.

She stops.  
For a moment, the world thins around her: sound dulls, color tightens.

Her foot shifts forward.  
Just one step.  
The reflex is subtle but seismic — a Caelian reaching toward a mortal.  
Her fingers twitch, as if testing gravity.

She freezes.  
The realization hits: _this is not what we do._  
The step becomes a pause.  
She exhales, steadies herself, and keeps walking — each stride deliberate, reclaiming detachment.

Behind her, a voice cuts through the noise — a **mother’s shout**:  
_“Leo!”_

Kaelarys turns slightly, just enough to see the reunion.  
The woman kneels, arms wide; the boy runs into them.  
They hold each other tightly, the world still moving around them.

Kaelarys watches a heartbeat longer.  
A faint curve lifts the corner of her mouth — not joy, not pity, just quiet relief that the order of things restored itself _without her._

She faces forward again, blending back into the current of strangers.  
The violin from earlier finds a softer melody, carrying her out of frame.
