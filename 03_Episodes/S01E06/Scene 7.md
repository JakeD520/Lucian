### **SCENE 7 – LIBRARY PATH / CONTINUOUS**

**EXT. PATH ALONG TU VIENNA LIBRARY – LATE AFTERNOON**

Camera stays fixed on **Kaelarys**, medium close.  
The background slides by in soft focus — trees, railings, passing students — the city reduced to color and motion.  
She walks at a measured pace, head slightly bowed.

Her eyes flicker down to the pavement, then ahead, then down again.  
You can feel thought, but no expression betrays it.  
The sound is pure presence: shoes on stone, wind through branches, a tram bell in the distance.

A few **figures** move around her — blurred outlines slipping in and out of frame.  
One brushes past, a shoulder almost grazing hers.

> **FIGURE (O.S., Austrian)**  
> Pardon!

Without stopping, she lifts a hand lightly.

> **KAELARYS (Austrian)**  
> Kein Problem.

She doesn’t look up.  
Her gaze stays on the path, rhythm unchanged.

For a moment, the world is all surface and motion: light shifting across her face, the faint reflection of passing cars in her eyes.  
The background noise swells — laughter, a bicycle bell — then recedes again, like waves.

She keeps walking.  
The camera never leaves her, tracking in real time until she disappears into the sunlit corridor leading toward **Secession**.

**FADE ON MOTION.**
