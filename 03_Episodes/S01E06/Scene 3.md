### **SCENE 1B – UNDERPASS / TRANSITION TO KARLSPLATZ**

**EXT. UNDERPASS – LATE MORNING**

The steps down from Karlskirche echo with the clatter of the city above.  
Kaelarys descends, leaving sunlight and hymns behind.  
The sound changes — wheels skimming concrete, the metallic pulse of traffic, reverb of voices overlapping.

past the fountain.


**WIDE:** the tunnel walls, covered edge to edge in graffiti — layers of tags, murals half-erased, colors bleeding like bruises.  
Most people rush through, heads low, barely seeing it.

Kaelarys stops halfway.  
Her gaze drifts over the wall as if she’s entered a gallery.  
She tilts her head slightly, studying shapes, the tension between beauty and decay.

A skateboarder zips past behind her, board scraping sparks from the rail.  
She doesn’t react; her attention never breaks.

She steps closer.  
**CLOSE:** fragments of paint — a crooked halo, a child’s face drawn over a scrawled curse, streaks of turquoise and gold.  
The light flickers from cars passing above, creating motion across the static art.

Her expression softens — not joy, not sadness — the calm of someone recognizing truth in disorder.

She exhales once, quiet.  
Then turns toward the far end of the tunnel where daylight blooms.

As she walks, her reflection slides over the wall, merging with the painted figures for a moment before peeling away.  
The noise of the street grows louder — music, chatter, fountain spray — **Karlsplatz** waiting ahead.
