Bridge of montage- 
**INT. SERIM GALLERY – TIMELESS**

Kaelarys rests in Lyra’s arms, her head against her sister’s chest. Her eyes are open, calm but wet, fixed on the tapestry’s unfinished edge. Lyra gently strokes her hair, steady and tender.

**KAELARYS**  
(soft, almost amused through the exhaustion)  
…Stupid tapestry.

(beat — Lyra glances at her, then back to the embroidery. A small, warm smile.)

**LYRA**  
(comforting, playful)  
Stupid tapestry, indeed.

---

Kaelarys exhales — a quiet, broken chuckle. Lyra smiles wider, leaning down to rest her head against Kaelarys’.

The two sisters stay there, huddled together on the floor beneath the looming threads.
