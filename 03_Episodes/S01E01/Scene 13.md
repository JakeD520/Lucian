Bridge of montage, volume drops-

**INT. SERIM GALLERY – TIMELESS**

Kaelarys rests in Lyra’s arms, her head against her sister’s chest. Her eyes are open, calm but wet, fixed on the tapestry’s unfinished edge. Lyra gently strokes her hair, steady and tender.

---

**KAELARYS**  
(soft, almost amused through the exhaustion)  
…Stupid tapestry.

**LYRA**  
(comforting, playful)  
Stupid tapestry, indeed.

Kaelarys exhales—a quiet, broken chuckle.

(beat)

She tilts her head up slightly, looking at Lyra. Her sister's face—calm, steady, still holding her.

**KAELARYS**  
(quieter now, raw)  
Look at me. I'm a mess.

(beat — her eyes soften)

**LYRA**
You're perfect.

Lyra's smiles. Tender. She strokes Kaelarys' hair once more.

**KAELARYS**  
(barely a whisper)  
I love you.

Lyra's breath catches. She leans down, resting her forehead against Kaelarys', holding her a little tighter.

**LYRA**  
(soft)  
I love you too, sister.

(HOLD — the two of them, huddled beneath the unfinished tapestry. Still. Safe. Together.)

**CUT TO CREDITS — montage music rises, carrying us out.**
