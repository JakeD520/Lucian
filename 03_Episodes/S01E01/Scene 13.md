Bridge of montage, volume drops-

**INT. SERIM GALLERY – TIMELESS**

Kaelarys stands in Lyra’s arms. Her eyes are open, calm but wet, fixed on the tapestry’s unfinished edge. Lyra gently strokes her hair, steady and tender.

---

**KAELARYS**  
(soft, almost amused through the exhaustion)  
…Stupid tapestry.

**LYRA**  
(comforting, playful)  
Stupid tapestry, indeed.

Kaelarys exhales—a quiet, broken chuckle.

(beat)

She turns to face Lyra. Her sister's face—calm, steady, still holding her.

**KAELARYS**  
(quieter now, raw)  
Look at me. I'm a mess.

(beat — her eyes soften)

**LYRA**
You're perfect.

Lyra's smiles. Tender. She strokes Kaelarys' hair once more.

**KAELARYS**  
(barely a whisper)  
I love you.

Lyra's breath catches. She rests her forehead against Kaelarys', holding her a little tighter.

**LYRA**  
(soft)  
I love you too, sister.

(HOLD — the two of them, huddled in front of the unfinished tapestry. Still. Safe. Together.)

**CUT TO CREDITS — montage music rises, carrying us out.**
