**INT. DINER – LATE NIGHT**

Neon hum. Color. Too much. Lights buzz, fry grease pops. A cracked vinyl booth cluttered with syrup bottles, half-empty mugs, a plate of pancakes going cold.

AELLA hunches over her plate. ZADIE lounges opposite, back to the window, sunglasses on even though it’s past midnight.

**AELLA** (poking her pancakes with her fork) 
You know… they never give you enough butter.

Zadie sips his coffee like champagne.

**AELLA** 
These things will be soup before she comes back.

She raises a hand for the WAITRESS—no dice.

**AELLA** 
Do you have enhanced hearing?

**ZADIE** (flat) 
No.

He whistles—sharp.

**ZADIE** (snapping his fingers) 
More butter please!

The waitress glances over, annoyed, vanishes toward the kitchen.

**AELLA** 
Jesus, Z. Great. Now she’s spitting in my butter.

**ZADIE** (smirk) 
Not gonna happen, Red. They only spit in items where the spittle can be obscured. Soup? Yup. Salad? Probably. Butter? Only a truly deranged server attempts a butter-spit. Too much surface area. No camouflage.

(Beat) She studies him like she’s closing in.

**AELLA** 
Do you have a pouch?

**ZADIE** (grinning) 
Tragically. Entirely sans pouch.

**AELLA** 
Fuck.

She shoves a bite in, unimpressed. He savors his coffee like it’s a retort.

**ZADIE** 
That’s— mm —nineteen, by the way.

Aella narrows her eyes.

(beat)

**AELLA** 
Why the fuck are we even here, Z? What’s your thing with these divey places?

**ZADIE** (after a thoughtful beat) 
Diners, my dear, are the last honest places in America. Stuck in this perfect amber ... from when conversations mattered and coffee came with refills and hope.

Aella raises an eyebrow but doesn't interrupt.

**ZADIE** 
You walk into one of these cathedrals at 2 a.m. and you're in a fucking Hopper painting crossed with noir—shadows, possibilities...

He nods toward their waitress.

**ZADIE** 
...and a waitress with tired eyes who might accidentally change your life.

Aella lets a genuine smile slip, appreciative of his romanticizing, then looks back to her plate.

**AELLA** 
You know what would change my life? More butter. (beat, inquisitive) Do you even have hair?

**ZADIE**
Nope. You're outta questions, my dear.

He sips his coffee smugly.

(beat)

**AELLA**
I don't know.  A shaved anteater?

She pauses.  Turns to Zadie.  Focused.

**AELLA** (grinning, sure of herself)
Wait ... No.   A T-Rex?

**ZADIE**(raising his fist in victory)
And that's another win for me.

A prolonged moment of silence.

**AELLA** 
Well…

She shrugs, holding her hands out in expectation.

**ZADIE** (as if surprised)
Oh…I'm an olm. 

**AELLA** (sneering)
What the fuck even is that, Z?

**ZADIE**  
Proteus anguinus A sad blind bastard of a salamander that lives in caves and hasn't seen sunlight in like a million years. Only found in—

**AELLA**(cutting him off.  Wagging her fork at him)
Uh, uh..That doesn’t count.

**ZADIE**
Oh….it counts.

He takes another sip of his coffee, pinky out.

**AELLA** 
Motherfucker.

The waitress approaches. 

Aella sits up straight, as if she's been caught doing something wrong.

The Waitress takes her time, drops a tiny dish with **one** butter pat.  She side-eyes Zadie, deliberately imposing on their conversation ... testing them.

Aella glares and the lone butter, then at Zadie.

The Waitress smiles smugly and walks away without a word.

**AELLA** (squinting after her) 
See? This is your fault. One? That thing’s a fucking postage stamp.

She spreads the lone pat with exaggerated care.

**ZADIE** 
One pat. No spit, though. Want me to tempt fate again?

Aella clocks a lonely PATRON at the counter, face lit by his phone, slightly turned, oblivious. A small plate of butter pats sits beside his elbow. Unloved.

**AELLA** (eyebrows up) 
Better idea.

Aella rises.

She hunches over, slowly cartoon-sneaking: knees high, arms bent like a Saturday-morning burglar. Zadie watches, amusement growing.

She _yoinks_ the plate in one smooth swipe.  She raises the plate in triumph  and struts back, presenting the haul like treasure.

Aella slides back into the booth, her smile larger than life as she eyes her pancakes with newfound excitement.

ZADIE (chuckling) 
You’re an absolute menace.

AELLA (smug) 
That’s called initiative, my friend.

She slathers. Eats. 

Lost in bliss, she does a little happy food-shimmy.

(Hold on Aella's gleeful eating.)

Zadie chuckles.  Takes a sip of his coffee. 

**AELLA** (mouth full, points at Zadie with her fork.) 
Okay. You go.

**ZADIE:**
Alright.  Person, place or thing?

**AELLA:**(between a bite)
Person.

Zadie straightens, mock-solemn.

**ZADIE** Do you sing?

Aella freezes, shoots him a looks that kill glare.  She balls up her napkin and pelts him with it.

**AELLA** No. Asshole. I am not—nor will I ever be—Taylor Swift.

Zadie cracks up, delighted. Clearly not the first time he's led with Swift in 20 Questions.

**ZADIE** Hey, a guy can hope. Me and my fellow Swifties live and breath Tay-Tay.

**AELLA**(chuckles) T-Swizzle my ass.

They share an easy, unguarded laugh. 

The Patron turns to the sound of their laugh.  He glances down and finally notices the missing butter, looks around—too late.

**CUT TO:** neon buzzing; the low diner music carries us out.

**FADE OUT**
