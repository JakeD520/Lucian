**MONTAGE - HALF-SPEED/MUSIC VIDEO STYLE** _"Famous Last Words" - My Chemical Romance_

**MUSEUM GALLERY** CLOSE on KAELARYS' face—tears, breaking: "We act like gods, but we're nothing more than orphans."

Beat.

Music EXPLODES.

**CUT TO:**

**MUSEUM PROP ROOM - BURST OF MOVEMENT** Doors SLAM open. Lucian and Rexus barrel out, prop swords gleaming under fluorescent lights. Staff member frozen, mouth agape.

**HALLWAY - RUNNING** Lucian's feet POUNDING marble. Rexus behind him, gaining. Their breath visible in the cold air-conditioned space.

**LUCIAN SPINS** - half-speed, coat flaring.

Rexus' sword ARCS down.

CLANG. Lucian parries. The impact reverberates. These aren't just props in their hands—every movement is precise, trained, deadly serious beneath the absurdity.

**CUT TO:**

**NYC STREETS - GOLDEN HOUR** Aella and Zadie drifting out of the alley doorway. Cigarette smoke curls between them. They bump shoulders—giggling.

They step out onto the sidewalk.

SCREECH. Electric scooter VEERS. They SCATTER—

Zadie catches Aella's arm. They BURST into laughter, bodies pressed against a storefront, hearts racing.

**CUT TO:**

**APARTMENT - PLUSHIE PILE** Evander's POV—ceiling spinning slowly. Colors breathing. A woman's face drifts into frame, smiling, distant.

REVERSE - Evander sits up through a sea of stuffed animals. Jennifer and Mandy on either side. A couple entwined on the couch. Someone dancing alone by the window, backlit. Two people deep in conversation, gesturing wildly about nothing.

Evander's hand reaches out—SLOW MOTION—fingers closing around a joint on the coffee table. He brings it to his lips. Lighter FLARES. Orange glow. Inhale. Hold. Exhale—smoke fills frame.

**CUT TO:**

**CLUB - VIP SECTION** PUSH IN on Val's face. That smirk. Adrian's silhouette disappearing into the crowd below. Val leans back, scotch in hand.

Below him: CHAOS. Bodies moving. Lights strobing. Bass THUMPING through everything.

Val raises his glass slightly. Victory.

**CUT TO:**

**MUSEUM GALLERY - WIDE OVERHEAD SHOT** Kaelarys crumpled in Lyra's arms. The Bayeux Tapestry stretches across the entire background—medieval figures frozen in their ancient war.

Just music.

Hold. Hold. Hold.

Lyra's hand strokes Kaelarys' hair.

**CUT TO:**

**MUSEUM LOBBY - ESCALATING** CLANG. CLANG. Lucian and Rexus burst into the main space.

Patrons TURN—

An elderly woman clutches her pearls.

A teenager pulls out his phone, filming.

A security guard speaks urgently into his radio.

Two college students CHEER.

The fight continues—parry, thrust, dodge. They're moving toward the MAIN ENTRANCE. Glass doors visible ahead.

More staff converging. Running. Shouting.

**CUT TO:**

**NYC STREETS - RECKLESS** CLOSE on Zadie's hand. Coke on his skin. He brings it to his nose—SNIFF. Doesn't even look around. People passing. Cabs honking. He dabs another bump.

Extends his hand to Aella.

She leans in—SNIFF. Straightens up, head tilting back.

They walk—swaying, serpentine.

Aella SPINS—arms out, face to the sky, streetlights becoming stars.

Zadie watches her, laughing—pure, unguarded.

**CUT TO:**

**APARTMENT HALLWAY - BEHIND EVANDER** Wide shot. Evander NUDE, walking down the narrow corridor. His arms outstretched like he's underwater. Joint between his lips, smoke trailing behind him like a veil.

He SWAYS. His hips move to the music. Completely unselfconscious. Completely gone.

His fingers drag along the wall.

Reaches the bathroom door.

Hand on knob.

Turns.

Steps in.

Door closes.

HOLD on the closed door.

**CUT TO:**

**CLUB - CLOSE ON VAL**

Tight on his face. The smirk. The satisfaction.

Then—

Something flickers.

The smile doesn't quite reach his eyes anymore.

He blinks slowly.

Around him—REVELERS. Dancing. Screaming. Laughing. Kissing.

But Val is REMOVED. We PUSH CLOSER as the world around him blurs.

His face relaxes.

The satisfaction drains away.

What's left is emptiness.

He stares into his glass.

Music still PUMPING but we can barely hear it now.

Val sinks into his seat.

Deeper.

His eyes go distant.

Deeper.

The lights play across his face but don't touch him.

Deeper.

Until he's just a body in a chair, surrounded by life he can't feel anymore.

**HOLD.**

**FADE TO BLACK.**
