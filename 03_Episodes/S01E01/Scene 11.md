#### **SCENE 3 – SERIM GALLERY**

**INT. SERIM GALLERY – TIMELESS**

The hall glows in still light. The Bayeux Tapestry stretches across the marble wall. Lyra drifts through the gallery, buoyant, humming softly. Her fingers toy with a necklace charm as she twirls in her loose layers.

**LYRA**  
(grinning, almost to herself)  
Maybe I’ll paint something.

(she spins, skirts flaring)  
Yes—something wild, something loud. I think I could.

(beat, laughing lightly)  
Why not? I mean… it could be fun.

**KAELARYS** 
(arms folded, watching distantly)  
Fun can be good.
Yes. I think that would be good for you, Lyra.

(she shifts her gaze to the tapestry)  

**LYRA**  
(glowing)  
Maybe colors they’ve never thought to mix. Reds spilling into blues.

(she presses the necklace to her lips, eyes bright)  
Something that doesn’t look like memory, but like—breath.

(beat — almost childlike in her excitement)  
I’d hang it here, with this tapestry. Why not?

**KAELARYS**  
(her arms unfold, a small smile breaking through)  
Yes… why not?

(she steps nearer, gaze moving between Lyra and the tapestry)  
I can almost see it — your colors spilling, refusing old patterns.

(beat — softer now) It would belong here.

**LYRA**  
(soft gasp, delighted)  
You think so? Truly?

(she brushes her hand over the tapestry’s edge, careful not to touch)  
Then maybe it wouldn’t just be mine. Maybe it would be ours.

**KAELARYS**  
(quiet, touched)  
Ours… yes. 

Lyra spins, hands sketching invisible brushstrokes in the air.

Kaelarys watches.  

She lifts a hand, mirroring Lyra’s gesture, stopping just short of the tapestry’s threads.

Her hand moves, slow. Fingers hover just above the tapestry — tracing the outline of a figure without touching.

Her eyes track the weave as she walks along. Threads tight. Colors bleeding.

**SFX:** Lyra keeps talking, bright, her words spilling. The words are muddled, as if far away.

Lyra twirls once more, unbroken in her delight.  

Kaelarys' gaze stays with the tapestry.

Kaelarys exhales. Her eyes keep tracing the weave — figures, banners, colors — until the rhythm falters.

The camera drifts with her gaze. Down the cloth. Past the order. Past the triumphs.

Slowly, the end comes into view: the final unfinished panel.  
Frayed threads. Incomplete.

(HOLD — the silence thickens here, the gallery heavier now.)

**KAELARYS**  
(too quiet for Lyra; mostly to herself)  
Yes… I think that would suit you.  
To make something of your own.

(HOLD — silence. Lyra beams, still caught in her imaginings. Kaelarys does not smile. Her eyes fix on the ragged threads, the unfinished edge.)

**KAELARYS**  
(steady, measured, breaking the silence.)  
The Normans began this work with such certainty. A grand vision.

(she gestures faintly at the tapestry)

And yet… they left it hanging.

They didn’t finish. They slipped away.

Lyra, captured by Kaelarys' sudden words, stops dancing. Turns towards Kaelarys.

**LYRA**  
(curious, indulgent)  
Unfinished. Yes. Strange that they would leave it so.

**KAELARYS**  (inward)
Didn’t even stay to see it through.  
Didn’t even wait… to see what it became.

Lyra listens.

**KAELARYS**   
We preserve it.  
We study it.  
We call it whole.

(Her breath quickens)

As though the absence was holy.

**LYRA**  
(steps closer, unsettled)  
Kaelarys?

Lyra moves towards Kaelarys, with urgency.

**KAELARYS**  
(turning, eyes burning)  
He didn’t stay.

**LYRA** (reaching out to her sister)
Kaelarys, what's wrong?

**KAELARYS**() trembles)
He didn’t even wait to see what we became.

**LYRA** (worried, confused)
Who?  The embroiderers?  What  are -

**KAELARYS**(cutting Lyra off)
No.  Him.  The Architect.  He made us and then just ...

**LYRA**  
(reaches out, gently)  
Kaelarys. The Architect gave you purpose—

**KAELARYS**  
(cuts her off)  
Purpose? 

(HOLD. Lyra recoils. Kaelarys presses her palm against the tapestry.)

We are the loose threads, Lyra.  
We are the unfinished embroidery.  
Fraying at the edge.

(HOLD — silence stretches. Lyra’s face stricken.)

**LYRA**  
(Calmly)  
No—He _sees_. The Architect always sees. He gave you your resonance, your—

**KAELARYS**  
(interrupts)  
My burden. My emptiness.

(Her voice cracks, brittle with frustration.)

What if He never meant to be with us?  
What if we’re nothing more than scraps He abandoned?

**LYRA**  
No—don’t say that.

**KAELARYS**  
(softer, quieter)  
It's true. He didn’t stay.

(Silence floods the gallery.)

Lyra, from behind,  places her hands on Kaelarys' shoulders.

**LYRA** (softly)
Kaelarys… don’t lose yourself. Remember The Pattern.

(beat)

It’s written into everything. Every path, every choice, every end. It doesn't fail us.

**KAELARYS**  
(lifts her head slowly)  
The Pattern.

(she laughs once, hollow)

We say it cannot lie.  
That it charts the future like scripture.

(beat — her hand gestures to the final panel)

But look here, Lyra.

The Pattern did not finish this tapestry.  
The Pattern did not stay when He left.

(HOLD — silence. The words echo in the marble hall. Lyra recoils as though struck.)

**KAELARYS**  
(softer now, trembling, almost to herself)  
The Pattern does not create.  
It only predicts.

(beat — eyes wet, hollow)

And what is a prophecy worth…  
if the one who wrote it is already gone?

Lyra wraps her arms around her sister, from behind, hugs her tightly.

**KAELARYS**  
(breath ragged, voice breaking )  
He’s never coming back.

(beat — she grips Lyra’s hand, eyes wet)

**CUT TO: MONTAGE.**
