# **SCENE 3 – SERIM GALLERY**

**INT. SERIM GALLERY – TIMELESS**

The hall glows in still light. The Bayeux Tapestry stretches across the marble wall. Lyra drifts through the gallery, buoyant, humming softly. Her fingers toy with a necklace charm as she twirls in her loose layers.

---

**LYRA**  
(grinning, almost to herself)  
Maybe I’ll paint something.

(she spins, skirts flaring)  
Yes—something wild, something loud. I think I could.

(beat, laughing lightly)  
Why not? I mean… it could be fun.

---

**KAELARYS**  
(arms folded, watching distantly)  
Fun can be good.

(beat, her voice softer but even)  
Yes. I think that would be good for you, Lyra.

(she shifts her gaze, detached)  
Something to keep your hands occupied.

---

**LYRA**  
(ignoring the coolness, still glowing)  
Maybe colors they’ve never thought to mix. Reds spilling into blues.

(she presses the necklace to her lips, eyes bright)  
Something that doesn’t look like memory, but like—breath.

(beat — almost childlike in her excitement)  
I’d hang it here, with these. Why not?

---

**KAELARYS**  
(beat — faint smile, not reaching her eyes)  
Why not, indeed.

(she exhales, gaze shifting to the far end of the tapestry)  
Yes, I think… that would suit you.

(her tone drops, distant)  
To make something of your own.

(HOLD — silence. Lyra beams, still caught in her imaginings. Kaelarys does not smile. Her eyes fix on the ragged threads, the unfinished edge swaying faintly.)

**KAELARYS**  
(steady, measured)  
The Normans began this work with such certainty. A grand vision.

(she gestures faintly at the frayed edge)

And yet… they left it hanging.

They didn’t finish. They slipped away.

---

**LYRA**  
(soft, indulgent)  
Unfinished. Yes. Strange that they would leave it so.

---

**KAELARYS**  
Didn’t even stay to see it through.  
Didn’t even wait… to see what it became.

---

**LYRA**  
(confused, watching her closely)  
Kaelarys…?

---

**KAELARYS**  
(voice sharpening, gaining momentum)  
We preserve it.  
We frame it.  
We patch the scraps and call it whole.

(Her breath quickens, tone rising)

As though the absence was holy!

---

**LYRA**  
(steps closer, unsettled)  
You’re not speaking of the tapestry anymore…

---

**KAELARYS**  
(turning, eyes burning)  
He didn’t stay.

(beat — she trembles, then erupts)

He didn’t even wait to see what we became!

---

**LYRA**  
(reaches out, desperate)  
Kaelarys—stop. The Architect gave you purpose—

---

**KAELARYS**  
(cuts her off, voice fierce)  
Purpose? 

(HOLD. Lyra recoils. Kaelarys presses her palm against the tapestry, trembling.)

We are the loose threads.  
An unfinished embroidery.  
Fraying at the edge.

(HOLD — silence stretches. Lyra’s face stricken.)

---

**LYRA**  
(pleading, near tears)  
Kaelarys, please—stop. You’re frightening me.

---

**KAELARYS**  
(turns on her, sharp, accusing)  
Frightening you?

(steps closer, eyes blazing)

You want comfort—words that fit. Neat little lines you can recite.  
That’s not truth, Lyra. That’s a lullaby.

---

**LYRA**  
(stammering, desperate)  
No—He _sees_. The Architect always sees. He gave you your role, your—

---

**KAELARYS**  
(interrupts, raw)  
My leash. My burden. My silence.

(Her voice cracks, brittle with fury.)

What if He never meant to finish us?  
What if we’re nothing more than scraps He abandoned?

---

**LYRA**  
(tearful, begging)  
No—don’t say that. Please don’t.

---

**KAELARYS**  
(erupts, projecting)  
Hurting _you_? Or hurting your illusion?

(Her rage falters; breath shakes. She clutches the tapestry, collapsing into grief.)

…He didn’t stay.

---

(Her knees buckle slightly; she braces against the fabric. Silence floods the gallery.)

---

**LYRA**  
(soft, broken)  
Kaelarys…

---

**KAELARYS**  
(whispers, defeated, eyes closing)  
Unfinished.

---

(HOLD. Stillness. Lyra trembles, terrified not just of Kaelarys’ words, but of the truth in them.)

---

**LYRA**  
Kaelarys… don’t lose yourself. Remember The Pattern.

(beat, urgent)

It’s written into everything. Every path, every choice, every end. It cannot fail us.

---

**KAELARYS**  
(lifts her head slowly — her voice rough, bitter)  
The Pattern.

(she laughs once, hollow)

They say it cannot lie.  
That it charts the future like scripture.

(beat — her hand tightens on the threads)

But look here, Lyra.

The Pattern did not finish this tapestry.  
The Pattern did not stay when He left.

---

**LYRA**  
(pleading, stepping closer)  
It _is_ His hand! The Architect’s gift—guidance, law, truth—

---

**KAELARYS**  
(spins on her, furious)  
Law? Truth?

(shouting now)

It is numbers.  
Probabilities.

(beat — softer, biting)

A mirror of our fear.

(Her eyes blaze, stepping closer)

We follow it like scripture.  
Bow to it like it loves us.

But The Pattern does not love us.  
It does not see us.

---

**LYRA**  
(tearful, almost begging)  
Without it, we’re lost! We would scatter, fall apart—

---

**KAELARYS**  
(cuts her down, voice fierce, almost breaking)  
Without it… we are free.

(HOLD — silence. The words echo in the marble hall. Lyra recoils as though struck.)

---

**KAELARYS**  
(softer now, trembling, almost to herself)  
The Pattern does not create.  
It only predicts.

(beat — eyes wet, hollow)

And what is a prophecy worth…  
if the one who wrote it is already gone?

(HOLD — her shoulders sag. The fight drains into dread. She sways, then her knees give. Kaelarys drops, crumpling to the marble floor.)

---

**LYRA**  
(gasping, rushing forward)  
Kaelarys!

(she falls to her knees, catching her sister in her arms, holding her close)

---

**KAELARYS**  
(breath ragged, voice breaking )  
He’s never coming back.

(beat — she grips Lyra’s hand, eyes wet)

**KAELARYS**  
Abandoned in His half-made world,  
clinging to silence as if it were love.

(beat — her voice drops, trembling)

We live as gods…  
but we’re nothing more than orphans.

(HOLD. The words hang in the silence. Lyra clutches her tighter, trembling, unable to answer. The gallery looms vast, the unfinished tapestry watching over them.)
