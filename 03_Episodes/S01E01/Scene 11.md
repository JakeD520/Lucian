#### **SCENE 3 – SERIM GALLERY**

**INT. SERIM GALLERY – TIMELESS**

The hall glows in still light. The Bayeux Tapestry stretches across the marble wall. Lyra drifts through the gallery, buoyant, humming softly. Her fingers toy with a necklace charm as she twirls in her loose layers.

**LYRA**  
(grinning, almost to herself)  
Maybe I’ll paint something.

(she spins, skirts flaring)  
Yes—something wild, something loud. I think I could.

(beat, laughing lightly)  
Why not? I mean… it could be fun.

**KAELARYS** 
(arms folded, watching distantly)  
Fun can be good.
Yes. I think that would be good for you, Lyra.

(she shifts her gaze to the tapestry)  

**LYRA**  
(glowing)  
Maybe colors they’ve never thought to mix. Reds spilling into blues.

(she presses the necklace to her lips, eyes bright)  
Something that doesn’t look like memory, but like—breath.

(beat — almost childlike in her excitement)  
I’d hang it here, with this tapestry. Why not?

**KAELARYS**  
(her arms unfold, a small smile breaking through)  
Yes… why not?

(she steps nearer, gaze moving between Lyra and the tapestry)  
I can almost see it — your colors spilling, refusing the old patterns.

(beat — softer now) It would belong here.

**LYRA**  
(soft gasp, delighted)  
You think so? Truly?

(she brushes her hand over the tapestry’s edge, careful not to touch)  
Then maybe it wouldn’t just be mine. Maybe it would be ours.

**KAELARYS**  
(tilts her head, warmed by Lyra’s spark)  
Ours, yes.  
A new breath woven into the old.

**KAELARYS**  
(quiet, touched)  
Ours… yes. 

She spins, hands sketching invisible brushstrokes in the air.

Kaelarys watches.  

(she lifts a hand, mirroring Lyra’s gesture, stopping just short of the tapestry’s threads)  
Your wild blues against their solemn reds… I can almost see it.

Her hand moves, slow. Fingers hover just above the tapestry — tracing the outline of a figure without touching.

Her eyes track the weave. Threads tight. Colors bleeding.

**SFX:** Lyra keeps talking, bright, her words spilling. The words are muddled, as if far away.

Lyra twirls once more, unbroken in her delight.  

Kaelarys' gaze stays with the tapestry.

Kaelarys exhales. Her eyes keep tracing the weave — figures, banners, colors — until the rhythm falters.

The camera drifts with her gaze. Down the cloth. Past the order. Past the triumphs.

Slowly, the end comes into view: the final unfinished panel.  
Frayed threads. Incomplete.

(HOLD — the silence thickens here, the gallery heavier now.)

**KAELARYS**  
(too quiet for Lyra; mostly to herself)  
Yes… I think that would suit you.  
To make something of your own.

(HOLD — silence. Lyra beams, still caught in her imaginings. Kaelarys does not smile. Her eyes fix on the ragged threads, the unfinished edge.)

**KAELARYS**  
(steady, measured, breaking the silence.)  
The Normans began this work with such certainty. A grand vision.

(she gestures faintly at the tapestry)

And yet… they left it hanging.

They didn’t finish. They slipped away.

Lyra, captured by Kaelarys' sudden words, stops dancing. Turns towards Kaelarys.

**LYRA**  
(curious, indulgent)  
Unfinished. Yes. Strange that they would leave it so.

**KAELARYS**  (inward)
Didn’t even stay to see it through.  
Didn’t even wait… to see what it became.

**LYRA**  
(confused, watching her closely)  
Kaelarys…?

**KAELARYS**  
(voice sharpening, gaining momentum)  
We preserve it.  
We study it.  
We call it whole.

(Her breath quickens, tone rising)

As though the absence was holy!

**LYRA**  
(steps closer, unsettled)  
Kaelarys?

Lyra moves towards Kaelarys, with urgency.

**KAELARYS**  
(turning, eyes burning)  
He didn’t stay.

**LYRA** (reaching out to her sister)
Kaelarys, what's wrong?

**KAELARYS**() trembles)
He didn’t even wait to see what we became.

**LYRA** (worried, confused)
Who?  The embroiderers?  What  are -

**KAELARYS**(cutting Lyra off)
No!  Him!  The Architect.  He made us and then just ...

**LYRA**  
(reaches out, desperate)  
Kaelarys—stop. The Architect gave you purpose—

**KAELARYS**  
(cuts her off again, fierce)  
Purpose? 

(HOLD. Lyra recoils. Kaelarys presses her palm against the tapestry, trembling.)

We are the loose threads, Lyra.  
We are the unfinished embroidery.  
Fraying at the edge.

(HOLD — silence stretches. Lyra’s face stricken.)

**LYRA**  
(forced calm)  
Kaelarys, please—stop. You’re frightening me.

**KAELARYS**  
(turns on her, sharp, accusing)  
Frightening you?

(steps closer, eyes blazing)

You want me to comfort—say words that fit. Neat little lines you can recite.  
That’s not truth, Lyra. That’s a lullaby.

**LYRA**  
(stammering, desperate)  
No—He _sees_. The Architect always sees. He gave you your resonance, your—

**KAELARYS**  
(interrupts, raw)  
My burden. My emptiness.

(Her voice cracks, brittle with frustration.)

What if He never meant to be with us?  
What if we’re nothing more than scraps He abandoned?

**LYRA**  
(tearful)  
No—don’t say that. Please don’t.

**KAELARYS**  
(softer, quieter)  
It's true.

(Her rage falters; breath shakes. She clutches the tapestry.)

…He didn’t stay.

(Her knees buckle slightly; she braces against the fabric. Silence floods the gallery.)

Lyra, from behind,  places her hands on Kaelarys' shoulders.  Steadying her.

**LYRA** (softly)
Kaelarys… don’t lose yourself. Remember The Pattern.

(beat)

It’s written into everything. Every path, every choice, every end. It doesn't fail us.

**KAELARYS**  
(lifts her head slowly — her voice rough, bitter)  
The Pattern.

(she laughs once, hollow)

We say it cannot lie.  
That it charts the future like scripture.

(beat — her hand tightens on the threads)

But look here, Lyra.

The Pattern did not finish this tapestry.  
The Pattern did not stay when He left.

**LYRA**  
(pleading, stepping closer)  
It _is_ His hand! The Architect’s gift—guidance, law, truth—

**KAELARYS**  
(spins on her, furious)  
Law? Truth?

(shouting now)

It is numbers, Lyra.  
Probabilities.

(beat — softer, biting)

A mirror.

(Her eyes blaze, stepping closer)

We follow it like a map.  
Bow to it like it loves us.

But The Pattern does not love us.  
It does not see us.

**LYRA**  
(tearful)  
Without it, we’re lost! We would scatter, fall apart—

**KAELARYS**  
(cuts her down, voice fierce, almost breaking)  
Without it… (her voice calms ) we are free.

(HOLD — silence. The words echo in the marble hall. Lyra recoils as though struck.)

**KAELARYS**  
(softer now, trembling, almost to herself)  
The Pattern does not create.  
It only predicts.

(beat — eyes wet, hollow)

And what is a prophecy worth…  
if the one who wrote it is already gone?

(HOLD — her shoulders sag. The fight drains into dread. She sways, then her knees give. Kaelarys drops, crumpling to the marble floor.)

**LYRA**  
(gasping, rushing forward)  
Kaelarys!

(she falls to her knees, catching her sister in her arms, holding her close)

**KAELARYS**  
(breath ragged, voice breaking )  
He’s never coming back.

(beat — she grips Lyra’s hand, eyes wet)

**KAELARYS**  
Abandoned in His half-made world,  
clinging to silence as if it were love.

(beat — her voice drops, trembling)

We elevate ourselves above the humans. 
We watch them as if our existence is superior.
We live as gods…  
but (beat) we’re nothing more than discarded orphans.

(HOLD. The words hang in the silence. Lyra clutches her tighter, trembling, unable to answer. The gallery looms vast, the unfinished tapestry watching over them.)

**CUT TO: MONTAGE.**
