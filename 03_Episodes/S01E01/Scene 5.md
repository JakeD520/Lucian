**INT. NIGHTCLUB – VIP BOOTH**

The club floor is chaos — bodies in strobe-light seizure, bass rolling like thunder under the skin.

At the far wall, behind a velvet rope and a black-suited bouncer, a **VIP booth** rises like an island. Leather curves in a half-circle, a low table gleaming with bottles, glasses, ice buckets.

**VAL** reclines at the center — androgynous chic, tailored perfection, every angle catching the light differently with each strobe. To the left, masculine edge in the line of jaw and lean frame. To the right, feminine elegance in the curve of hand, cascade of hair. Eyes predatory, amused, restless.

Around them, an **entourage** — sycophants, lovers, courtiers in all but name. Laughter too loud, gestures too rehearsed, as though each is auditioning to stay in orbit.

But Val is detached. The glass dangles loosely in their fingers. They sip without tasting. Their gaze drifts over the crowd, scanning like a sovereign who’s seen this procession a thousand nights.

_Every smile looks recycled. Every dance step, choreographed. Every laugh, the same as last night’s laugh._

**VAL** ( in expression) The masque repeats. Different masks, same faces.

_The entourage roars at some joke. Val doesn’t. They smile faintly, but the eyes say it clearly: boredom._

The bass swells. The **INTRUDER** enters frame.

The BOUNCER straightens, then relaxes. He knows this man. Everyone does. Tall. Tailored. Smile polished like chrome. A WOMAN clings to his arm, radiant, lacquered in the sheen of money well-spent.

They exchange a clasp at the rope — old familiarity. The man leans in, voice low, a conspiratorial murmur. A folded pair of hundreds slip from hand to hand with practiced ease.

Not so subtle. Not to VAL’s eyes.

VAL watches, glass halfway to their lips. A faint narrowing — irritation? amusement? Hard to tell.

The rope opens. The man steps through without hesitation, as though expected, as though this space were his second home. The entourage hardly notices.

He slides into the booth opposite Val, the woman tucked neatly against his side. Comfortable. Confident. Certain.

**INTRUDER** (pleasant, declarative) This is the best seat in the house. Thought I’d join you.

The entourage titter — some notice the new faces, some oblivious. The man lets the line hang, expecting his reputation to do the rest.

VAL’s eyes linger. A squint, tiny, surgical. Then… the smile. Slow. Dangerous.

At last, something to do.

**INTRUDER** (to Val, easy) I’d have remembered seeing you here before. You’re not the sort to blend.

_Val arches a brow, not flattered but entertained. They sip, eyes locked._

**VAL** And you’re not the sort to miss anyone worth remembering.

_The INTRUDER smiles at that, appreciative — not many return his serve with precision. He leans in a little, lowering his voice so it cuts through the music._

**INTRUDER** I make it a point to know everyone who matters in a room. You? You matter.

_VAL lets the words hang, then laughs softly — not dismissive, but genuinely pleased. They tip their glass toward him._

**VAL** How refreshing. Most men recite their triumphs. You lead with recognition.

**INTRUDER** Recognition is the triumph. The rest is chatter.

_VAL nods slowly, savoring the line. They like this man. They could like him a lot._

**VAL** (leaning forward, conspiratorial) Then consider yourself recognized.

_The INTRUDER grins, raising his glass. They clink, eyes steady. For a beat, it’s not adversarial at all. It’s possibility. Two sovereigns meeting on neutral ground, enjoying the game for its own sake._
