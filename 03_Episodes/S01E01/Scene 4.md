**EXTREME CLOSE-UP - EVANDER'S FACE**

_EVANDER (30s, deeply thoughtful eyes, the kind of face that suggests he's seen through society's illusions). He takes a slow, practiced hit from a joint, holds it with the reverence of a wine connoisseur, then exhales thoughtfully._

**EVANDER** _(voice like warm honey, tinged with smoke)_ 
You know what's fascinating about attachment? Not the Buddhist kind - fuck that noise for a minute - I'm talking about the primal shit. The way a person's sense of home becomes... indistinguishable from their sense of self.

_He takes another hit, eyes distant but laser-focused._

**EVANDER (CONT'D)** 
Think about it. Your home - whether that's a house, a neighborhood, a way of life, an ideology - it's not separate from you. It's the extended nervous system of your identity. Touch it, and you feel it. Threaten it, and every defense mechanism you've ever developed comes online.

_His fingers gesture lazily, drawing invisible connections in the air._

**EVANDER (CONT'D)** 
The suburbanite who calls the cops on kids skating in "his" parking lot. The activist who doxxes people for using the wrong pronouns. The patriot who bombs abortion clinics. The liberal who tries to get people fired for old tweets. Different tribes, same fucking circuit firing.

_He pauses, studying the joint like it contains cosmic wisdom._

**EVANDER (CONT'D)** 
See, here's where it gets beautiful and terrifying at the same time. Each person deploys whatever weapons they've got access to. The physically strong resort to violence - it's efficient, direct, monkey-brain simple. The socially connected become bullies, use shame and ostracism like a medieval siege. The intellectually gifted will use their wits to outsmart.

_He chuckles, a sound both amused and slightly disturbed._

**EVANDER (CONT'D)** 
It's never about hatred, you see. It's always about love. Love so fierce, so territorial, so confused with identity that it becomes indistinguishable from violence. They're not monsters - that would be easier to understand. They're people protecting extensions of themselves with the same desperate urgency they'd protect their own children.

(He looks past camera, almost tender.)

_Another thoughtful drag._

**EVANDER (CONT'D)** 
And the wildest part? They're not wrong to feel righteous. From their perspective, they are literally protecting their extended self from annihilation. When someone threatens your home - your physical, psychological, ideological home - you're not experiencing it as an attack on some external thing. You're experiencing it as death.

_His voice drops to almost a whisper, but remains perfectly clear._

**EVANDER (CONT'D)** 
So they fight like their lives depend on it. Because, in a very real sense, they do. The version of themselves that depends on that particular configuration of home - it really would die if they didn't fight.

_He closes his eyes for a moment, as if integrating some profound realization._

_A beat of silence._

**MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)** _(confused, slightly stoned)_ 
So... like... you're saying that Jerry was the good guy? Tom was the asshole?

_PULL BACK TO REVEAL:_

**WIDE SHOT - PLUSHIE PARADISE**

_EVANDER, completely nude, sprawled luxuriously in what can only be described as a sea of plush toys - teddy bears, unicorns, cartoon characters, an entire ecosystem of soft, colorful comfort. A YOUNG WOMAN, also nude (20s, beautiful, uninhibited) has her head on his chest, her leg draped across his groin with casual intimacy._

Evander lowers the joint toward her. She takes a drag with practiced ease.

_Nearby, another COUPLE lies among the plushies - the MAN strategically covering himself with what appears to be a large elephant plush toy, while his FEMALE PARTNER lies on her back, completely unselfconscious in her nudity._

_The entire scene is surreal, philosophical - like if Alan Watts had been reborn as a hedonistic guru in a toy store._

**_NAKED WOMAN NEXT TO ELEPHANT GUY_** 
No, dude, he's saying that the cat was protecting his home from the mouse.

_The man next to her perksâ€¦his eyes searching his thoughts for clarity._

**WOMAN DRAPED ACROSS EVANDER** 
So, which one was right, Van? Tom or Jerry?

Evander takes a hit from the joint. He holds it like a pro, exhales slowly.

_(beat)_

**EVANDER**
_Exactly, my lovely._

**_FADE OUT._**
