**INT. SERIM GALLERY – TIMELESS**

The Bayeux Tapestry looms. Threads shimmer under timeless light. **Lyra** twirls beneath it, skirts sweeping like a brushstroke. She slows, breathless, eyes locked on the embroidery.

(HOLD. The echo of her spin fades.)

**LYRA**  
Why do we keep these here, anyway? Why in Serim?

**KAELARYS**  
_(fond, almost rote)_  
We always have. We capture creations at the pinnacle of their being… when they most fully embody their creator's vision.

(HOLD. Kaelarys' voice lingers against the silence.)

**LYRA**  
The pinnacle?  
_(beat, her tone light, thoughtful)_  
But on Earth, this tapestry is faded. Patched, even reworked. Isn't that still art? Doesn't the decay add to it? The stains, the wear… aren't those part of the story?

(HOLD. CU: Kaelarys. A flicker of surprise. She didn't expect the question.)

**KAELARYS**  
Decay can reveal beauty, yes…  
_(beat)_  
But the vision—the spark that began it—that is what we preserve. The moment it became whole.

**LYRA**  
When the creator has moved on?

(HOLD. Silence stretches. Kaelarys stiffens. CU: her eyes flicker—something sharp, painful. An intrusive thought.)

She forces a small smile, brushing it aside.

**KAELARYS**  
…Well. Yes. In a way. When the vision is complete, it's left to endure.  
_(beat — her voice softer, but there's tension underneath.)_

**LYRA**  
_(playful, testing)_  
Do you ever wonder… if I painted something? Or if you sculpted a statue? Would we display it here?

(HOLD. Kaelarys' smile falters. The silence answers first.)

**KAELARYS**  
_(quiet, but firm)_  
That's not what we do, Lyra.

(HOLD. Lyra absorbs it. Her playfulness ebbs away.)

**LYRA**  
The humans fill their world with works—paintings, poems, cathedrals.  
_(beat, voice dipping)_  
And us… nothing.

She turns slightly, catching her reflection on the marble floor.

**LYRA**  
Funny, isn't it? Everything about me screams 'artist.'

(HOLD. She spins the charm at her neck, glances down at tattoos, fabrics, wild hair. She laughs softly—uncertain, not joyous.)

**LYRA**  
But none of it is mine. The style, the ink, the songs I hum… all borrowed. From them.  
_(beat — quieter, her voice catching)_  
It's like I'm only wearing the mask. Pretending to be what I can never really be.

Her eyes glisten. She presses her hand into her palm, nails biting.

(HOLD. Kaelarys watches, face softening.)

Kaelarys steps closer, slow, deliberate. She takes Lyra's hand, pries the fingers open gently, and traces the **star tattoo** there.

(HOLD. Her thumb moves in slow circles. CU: Lyra's breath trembling.)

**KAELARYS**  
Oh, no, Lyra… don't you see?  
_(beat — her voice low, steady, intimate)_  
You are not only a creator.  
_(she meets her sister's eyes)_  
You are creation.

(HOLD. Lyra's lips part. She doesn't pull away. For the first time, she lets Kaelarys hold her.)

**KAELARYS**  
_(she glances up at the tapestry, then back to Lyra)_  
Do you think these embroiderers spun the wool?  
_(beat — a faint smile, tender)_  
Do you think they harvested the madder root for red, the weld for gold?

She gestures softly to the tapestry.

**KAELARYS** _(cont'd)_  
Do you think Bishop Odo rode into battle? Swung the sword? Burned the villages?

_(beat — softer now, tracing the tattoo on Lyra's palm)_  
No. They worked with what already was. Wool. Dye. Blood. Memory…  
_(her eyes lift to the embroidery)_  
…and shaped something that endures.

(HOLD. Silence. Then—Kaelarys' voice drops.)

**KAELARYS** _(cont'd)_  
Every stitch here—  
_(she releases Lyra's hand, gestures to a panel)_  
—is a window. A window to the soul of whoever pulled that thread.

_(beat)_  
But it's more than that.

She steps closer to the tapestry, eyes scanning the embroidery.

**KAELARYS** _(cont'd)_  
When we stand before art, we don't just see the maker.  
_(she turns back to Lyra)_  
We see ourselves.

(HOLD. Lyra watches, listening.)

**KAELARYS** _(cont'd)_  
You saw grief in these stitches. Trembling hands. Saxon women mourning.  
_(beat, softer)_  
I see precision. Discipline. The refusal to let memory die.

_(she gestures between them)_  
Two souls, looking at the same threads... and finding different truths.

**KAELARYS** _(cont'd)_  
That's the gift of creation, Lyra. It doesn't just reveal the maker—  
_(beat)_  
—it reveals the one who receives it.

(HOLD. Her voice drops, almost reverent.)

**KAELARYS** _(cont'd)_  
Art is a conversation across time. Across worlds.  
_(she looks back at the tapestry)_  
The embroiderer speaks. Bishop Odo speaks. The wool, the blood, the battle—they all speak.

_(she meets Lyra's eyes)_  
And when you look... _you_ speak back.

(HOLD.)

**KAELARYS** _(cont'd)_  
What you see in art—what moves you, what haunts you—  
_(quieter)_  
That is you, Lyra. Your soul, answering theirs.

(HOLD. She releases Lyra's hand, but the trace of her touch lingers.)

**KAELARYS** _(cont'd)_  
That's why it matters. Not because it's new, but because it speaks. Because it connects.

Lyra looks back to the tapestry.

**LYRA**  
_(soft, almost to herself)_  
And if I am art… then so are you. So are all of us.

(HOLD. Kaelarys watches her. The words settle. Almost prayerful.)

**FADE.**
