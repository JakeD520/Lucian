**INT. SERIM GALLERY – TIMELESS**

The Bayeux Tapestry looms. Threads shimmer under timeless light. **Lyra** twirls beneath it, skirts sweeping like a brushstroke. She slows, breathless, eyes locked on the embroidery.

(HOLD. The echo of her spin fades.)

**LYRA**  
Why do we keep these here, anyway? Why in Serim?

**KAELARYS**  
_(fond, almost rote)_  
We always have. We capture creations at the pinnacle of their being… when they most fully embody their creator’s vision.

(HOLD. Kaelarys’ voice lingers against the silence.)

**LYRA**  
The pinnacle?

_(beat, her tone light, thoughtful)_

But on Earth, this tapestry is faded. Patched, even reworked. Isn’t that still art? Doesn’t the decay add to it? The stains, the wear… aren’t those part of the story?

(HOLD. CU: Kaelarys. A flicker of surprise. She didn’t expect the question.)

**KAELARYS**  
Decay can reveal beauty, yes…  
_(beat)_  
But the vision—the spark that began it—that is what we preserve. The moment it became whole.

**LYRA**  
When the creator has moved on?

(HOLD. Silence stretches. Kaelarys stiffens. CU: her eyes flicker—something sharp, painful. An intrusive thought.)

She forces a small smile, brushing it aside.

**KAELARYS**  
…Well. Yes. In a way. When the vision is complete, it’s left to endure.

_(beat — her voice softer, but there’s tension underneath.)_

**LYRA**  
_(playful, testing)_  
Do you ever wonder… if I painted something? Or if you sculpted a statue? Would we display it here?

(HOLD. Kaelarys’ smile falters. The silence answers first.)

**KAELARYS**  
_(quiet, but firm)_  
That’s not what we do, Lyra.

(HOLD. Lyra absorbs it. Her playfulness ebbs away.)

**LYRA**  
The humans fill their world with works—paintings, poems, cathedrals.

_(beat, voice dipping)_

And us… nothing.

She turns slightly, catching her reflection in the tapestry glass.

**LYRA**  
Funny, isn’t it? Everything about me screams ‘artist.’

(HOLD. She spins the charm at her neck, glances down at tattoos, fabrics, wild hair. She laughs softly—uncertain, not joyous.)

**LYRA**  
But none of it is mine. The style, the ink, the songs I hum… all borrowed. From them.

_(beat — quieter, her voice catching)_

It’s like I’m only wearing the mask. Pretending to be what I can never really be.

Her eyes glisten. She presses her hand into her palm, nails biting.

(HOLD. Kaelarys watches, face softening.)

Kaelarys steps closer, slow, deliberate. She takes Lyra’s hand, pries the fingers open gently, and traces the **star tattoo** there.

(HOLD. Her thumb moves in slow circles. CU: Lyra’s breath trembling.)

**KAELARYS**  
Oh, no, Lyra… don’t you see?

_(beat — her voice low, steady, intimate)_

You are not only a creator.

_(she meets her sister’s eyes)_

You are creation.

(HOLD. Lyra’s lips part. She doesn’t pull away. For the first time, she lets Kaelarys hold her.)

**KAELARYS**  
Do you think the embroiderers made the thread?  
_(beat — a faint smile, tender)_  
Do you think Bishop Odo made the battle?

She gestures softly to the tapestry.

**KAELARYS** _(cont’d)_  
No. They worked with what already was. Wool, dye, blood, memory… and shaped something that endures.

_(beat — softer now, tracing the tattoo)_

The painter doesn’t create the paint. The painter doesn’t invent light.

(HOLD. Silence. Then—Kaelarys’ voice drops to a near-whisper.)

**KAELARYS** _(cont’d)_  
Every stitch, every brush of paint—it’s a window. A window to the creator’s soul.

_(beat, reverent)_

And when we look at art, we don’t just see the maker. We see ourselves. Two souls, speaking through symbols across time.

(HOLD. She releases Lyra’s hand, but the trace of her touch lingers.)

**KAELARYS** _(cont’d)_  
That’s why it matters. Not because it’s new, but because it speaks. Because it connects.

Lyra looks back to the tapestry. CU: her reflection shimmers faintly in the glass, as if stitched among the figures.

**LYRA**  
_(soft, almost to herself)_  
And if I am art… then so are you. So are all of us.

(HOLD. Kaelarys watches her. The words settle. Almost prayerful.)

**FADE.**
