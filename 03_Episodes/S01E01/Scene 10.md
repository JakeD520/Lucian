### **INT. NIGHTCLUB – VIP BOOTH – CONTINUOUS**

The glasses clink. Bass hums beneath, steady as a heartbeat.  
Val and **ADRIAN** hold each other’s gaze — a kingdom and a conqueror, deciding which is which.

**VAL**  
(to the woman, gentle)  
And you — what’s your name?

**WOMAN**  
Cadence.

Val’s smile curves; they tip the glass slightly, eyes never leaving hers.

**VAL**  
Pleased to meet you, Cadence.  
(beat; turns back to the woman, not the man)  
Is he taking good care of you tonight?

A subtle shift — focus on _her_, not _him._  
Adrian catches it instantly.

He straightens, smooth grin sharpening.

**ADRIAN**  
(laughs)  
He has a name.  
Adrian Vey.  
You’ve probably heard it once or twice — cars, clubs, the fights in Monaco.

He says it like a headline, confident, waiting for the flicker of recognition.

**ADRIAN (cont’d)**  
I make it a point to take care of more than one person a night.  
But tonight? She gets the best of me.

Val’s smile stays; their eyes drift toward another companion. A whisper. A soft laugh.  
Adrian’s line lands in the quiet and dies there.

He pushes forward, trying to reclaim the air.

**ADRIAN (cont’d)**  
Anyway — just flew in for the Grammys.  
Private jet, whole thing. You know how it goes—

Val’s head snaps back toward him. The smile thins.

**VAL**  
Adrian.  
You mistake this for an audition.

The booth stills. The bass drops into a low, heavy roll.

Adrian blinks, then forces an easy grin.

**ADRIAN**  
I don’t audition. I arrive.  
Rooms open, people listen.  
That’s not trespass — that’s presence.

Val considers him like a scientist might study fire.

**VAL**  
Presence is not ownership.  
To stride into another kingdom uninvited, to sit upon its throne, whisper to its guards as though they were yours — what do you call that?

**ADRIAN**  
(smirk)  
Confidence.  
You should try it sometime.

**VAL**  
(conspiratorial smile)  
Conquest is an old game, Adrian.  
The tapestry of history is woven from it.  
But even conquerors know the courtesy of sending word ahead.

**ADRIAN**  
Respect’s earned, not handed out.  
You take it, you keep it, that’s the rule.

Val’s tone drops — softer, deadlier.

**VAL**  
Courtesy is survival.

A hush radiates from the booth — sound bending around the words.

**VAL (cont’d)**  
Make no mistake: you didn’t _arrive_, Adrian.  
You were _tolerated._  
A guest indulged only while you amuse.  
(leans in)  
Bore me, presume beyond your station, and this kingdom will remind you how short a fall power really is.

Adrian’s grin twitches, caught between laughter and fear.  
He checks Cadence’s eyes — she’s silent, unsure which way to lean.

He exhales, gathers himself, then stands — smooth again, loud again.

**ADRIAN**  
Hey, relax. All good vibes.  
I’ve got another party waiting anyway. Tyla’s expecting me.

He squeezes Cadence’s hand, flashes one last grin.

**ADRIAN (cont’d)**  
Pleasure, Val. Nice empire you’ve got.

He disappears through the rope, already re-narrating himself to the crowd.

Val watches, motionless.  
Then, a small smile — equal parts satisfaction and boredom.

**VAL**  
(quiet, to themself)  
Every century invents its own barbarians.

A sip. A flicker of strobe.  
**FADE OUT.**
