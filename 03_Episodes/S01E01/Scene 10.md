##### **INT. NIGHTCLUB – VIP BOOTH**

Bass thumps through velvet walls, muffled but constant — a heartbeat under every breath. Neon spills across low glass tables littered with half-empty bottles and scattered limes. The crowd beyond is all blur and strobe, but here, in the booth, time slows.

The INTRUDER - ADRIAN and his companion are sitting across from them.  His arms stretched across the seat, his legs spread, one ankle resting on his knee ... taking up more space than necessary. 

Val leans forward, voice steady, eyes warm.

**VAL**  
(to the woman, gentle)  
And you — what’s your name?

**WOMAN**  
Cadence.

Val’s smile curves; they tip the glass slightly, eyes never leaving hers.

**VAL**  
Pleased to meet you, Cadence.  
(beat; turns back to the woman, not the man)  
Is he taking good care of you tonight?

A subtle shift — focus on _her_, not _him._  
Adrian catches it instantly.

He straightens, smooth grin sharpening.

**ADRIAN**  
(laughs)  
He has a name.  
Adrian Vey.  
You’ve probably heard it once or twice — cars, social media, the fights in Monaco.

He says it like a headline, confident, waiting for the flicker of recognition.

**ADRIAN (cont’d)**  
I make it a point to take care of more than one person a night.  
But tonight? She gets the best of me.

Val’s smile stays; their eyes drift toward another companion. A whisper. A soft laugh.  
Adrian’s line lands in the quiet and dies there.

He pushes forward, trying to reclaim the air.

**ADRIAN (cont’d)**  
Anyway — just flew in for the Grammys.  
Private jet, whole thing. You know how it goes—

Val’s head snaps back toward him. The smile thins.

**VAL**  
Adrian.  
You mistake this for an audition.

The booth stills. The bass drops into a low, heavy roll.

Move through the club organism again.  Music. Bass. Dancing.  Lasers.  We are ingested by this being.  Floating between bodies and revelry.

**BACK AT BOOTH**

(HOLD - The shift in tension is sharp.  Jarring.)

Adrian blinks, then forces an easy grin.

**ADRIAN**  (confident, aggressive)
I don’t audition. I arrive.  
Rooms open, people listen.  
That’s not a tryout — that’s presence.

Val considers him like a scientist might study fire.

**VAL**  
Presence is not ownership.  
To stride into another kingdom uninvited, to sit upon its throne, whisper to its guards as though they were yours — what do you call that?

**ADRIAN**  
(smirk)  
Confidence.  
You should try it sometime.

Val takes a sip from their glass.  Adrian turns to Candace speaking directly in her ear.  She is fully focused  on him. 

**VAL**  
You say you arrive, Adrian —  

Adrian returns his focus to Val.

**VAL**
... but arrival is nothing.  
Anyone can cross a threshold,  
sit where they don’t belong.

They tilt their head, studying him like a riddle.

**VAL**  
The weight isn’t in arrival.  
It’s in being received.  
Otherwise. are you presence  —  
Or are you trespass.

Val’s tone drops — softer, deadlier.

Another trip through the club. The vibe is dark. Ominous.  Claustrophobic.

**BACK AT BOOTH:**

**VAL**  

(they lean in, eyes steady)  
Yes, Adrian… I know of you.  
You and your brother.  
Your millions of disciples — boys, mostly —  
hungry for a father’s voice.  
Hungry in the same way you were.

Adrian's finger drumming against his glass.  Stills.

(quiet, assured)  
You grew up never quite good enough for your father.  
Always chasing the nod, the hand on the shoulder that never came.  
And now you (beat) _arrive_ — loud, certain — so the room will give you what he wouldn’t.

Their tone softens, but the weight doesn’t ease.

**VAL**  
You weren’t cared for enough to receive it.  
So now you give it, dressed as confidence.  
But it still tastes like hunger.

A hush radiates from the booth — sound bending around the words.

Adrian shifts back in the booth’s cushion, putting an inch more distance between them.

**VAL (cont’d)**  
Make no mistake: you didn’t _arrive_, Adrian.  
You were _tolerated._  
A guest indulged only while you amuse. 
(leans in)  
Bore me, presume beyond your station, and this kingdom will remind you how short a fall power really is.

Adrian’s grin twitches, caught between laughter and something else.  Uncertainty?
He checks Cadence’s eyes — she’s silent, unsure which way to lean.

(HOLD.  Dark Techno music is louder. Let the tension build. )

He exhales, gathers himself, then stands — smooth again, loud again.

**ADRIAN**  
Hey, relax. All good vibes.  
I’ve got another party waiting anyway. Tyla, you know the hot little singer from Johannesburg.  She's expecting me.

He squeezes Cadence’s hand, flashes one last grin.

**ADRIAN (cont’d)**  
Pleasure. Nice empire you’ve got here.

He slips through the rope. The crowd folds around him instantly, hungry for the story he’s already retelling. His voice is swallowed by bass — distorted, mechanical, relentless.

**ON VAL**  
Unmoved. A small smile.  
They raise their glass, a lone still point against the strobe and the beat’s dark pulse.

 The music carries us.
