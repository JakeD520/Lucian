INT. SERVICE CORRIDOR — NIGHT — 2:07 A.M.

A narrow stairwell. AELLA’s breath fogs in the stale air. She’s got that bright, dangerous look — ready to pry life out of a dead city. ZADIE follows, hands in pockets, smirking.

SOUNDS: muffled bass. A laugh. A musical phrase like someone tuning a mic.

AELLA  
(whispers)  
Hear that?

ZADIE  
Probably a very committed bar closing its eyes.

AELLA grins and yanks a rusted door open. Light spills out — warm, too-colorful, a breath of orchids and incense.

INT. UNDERGROUND ROOM — CONTINUOUS

The room is saturated: strings of yellow and magenta lights, paper petals scattered like confetti, sparklers fizzing in mason jars. People in bright, mismatched finery lounge on sofas and floor cushions. There’s a celebratory warmth — but something is… extra. Too hands-on. Too smiley.

A woman glides up to AELLA with a bracelet, presses it into her palm with a hug that lingers fractionally long.

WOMAN  
Welcome. Take one. Stay as long as you like.

AELLA takes the bracelet, charmed. ZADIE is already being eye-balled — a topless reveler (implied; she’s flamboyantly costumed, not explicit) sidles in, half-dance, half-offer of a cheeky high-five.

ZADIE  
(leaning away, grinning)  
While I appreciate the attention, miss, I’m strictly cutting random grinding with forest nymphs out of my diet. And carbs. Carbs are no bueno.

The reveler laughs, tosses a handful of petals in his face, sashays off.

AELLA breathes it in — the light, the noise, the sense of being seen. She moves deeper, fingers trailing through floating petals.

ONSTAGE: A small circle forms. A host, too-sparkly, claps rhythmically. People close in — not hostile, just very eager.

HOST  
(cheerful, a touch intense)  
Tonight we share. We speak our names. We claim our joy.

A few hands lift. A couple in the corner starts an odd non-verbal "trust" exchange — palm on palm, eyes locked, breath shared a beat too long.

AELLA’s smile lingers, then thins. The room’s energy tilts. Eyes lengthen; gestures become insistently friendly.

AELLA  
(soft, to Zadie)  
Dude. We should probably— we should get the fuck out of here.

ZADIE watches a reveler approach, offering two scarves and an eager grin.

ZADIE  
(cheeky, not panicked)  
What? No. This is the good stuff. I’ve been training for a moment like this. Fairy-nymph cheat day is finally upon us.

AELLA punches his arm; it’s playful, affectionate — a practiced move between siblings.

AELLA  
I swear, Z.

ZADIE’s grin falters as the host gestures; a hush forms — the attention shifts to the little stage. For a heartbeat the room holds its breath, poised.

HOST  
Tonight’s featured performance — please welcome… MATTY — with a rendition of “Total Eclipse of the Heart.”

A beat. A man in a sequined jacket bounds up with a mic. The room explodes — not in lust, but in relieved, ridiculous enthusiasm. He belts the first line, theatrically, off-key in the most earnest way possible.

MATTY  
(turns to the crowd)  
(Turn around) every now and then I get a little bit lonely...

AELLA and ZADIE look at each other, blink. The tension bleeds out into laughter — the laugh of people who’ve been braced for a trap and found karaoke instead.

ZADIE  
(whispers, mock-horrified)  
Karaoke. Of course. The oldest ritual.

AELLA’s face softens. She lets out a breath she didn’t know she held.

AELLA  
(grinning)  
Weirdest. Cult. Ever.

They edge toward the door, shoulders closer now. Behind them, Matty hits the dramatic key change. Someone hands him a sparkler. The room cheers, affectionate and earnest.

EXT. BACK ALLEY — NIGHT — MOMENTS LATER

The stair door clicks shut behind them. The city is ordinary again: trash can lids, a blinking neon sign, a taxi engine idling.

ZADIE  
(arms spread, theatrically)  
Well that was… intimate.

AELLA  
(throws his shoulder)  
You’re insufferable.

They laugh, step into a silent street that somehow feels fuller for having been briefly ridiculous together.

AELLA  
(softer)  
Thanks for coming.

ZADIE  
(smirk)  
Wouldn’t miss your midnight scavenger hunts for the world.

They move off, same stride, differing energies — Aella still fizzing, Zadie amused — back into the night.

---

**INT. UNDERGROUND PARTY – 2:23 A.M.**

The door creaks open.

BOOM — sound, light, movement. A pulse that doesn’t belong to the city above.

AELLA steps in first, eyes wide, already grinning. Behind her, ZADIE strolls in with hands deep in his jacket, sunglasses still on, smirk locked.

**AELLA**  
Holy shit.

**CAMERA SWEEP — THE ROOM:**  
Packed wall to wall, maybe forty people, maybe more. Every color in motion — sequins, scarves, painted skin. A haze of incense and vape clouds. Too many smiles. Too much energy. It’s overwhelming and magnetic, like stepping into a festival compressed into a basement.

Someone immediately loops a garland over Aella’s neck, laughing. Another thrusts a drink into her hand. Aella doesn’t question it — she spins once, hair catching the lights.

**ZADIE**  
(to himself, deadpan)  
Welcome to the fever dream. Population: us.

**AELLA**  
Come on. This is amazing.

She lets herself be pulled into a **brief dance** by a stranger — a messy, spinning twirl, more joy than grace. She laughs, hands the drink back untouched, still dizzy.

Zadie watches, leaning against a post, pretending bored detachment. But the corners of his mouth twitch.

**ZADIE**  
(calling out)  
Careful. This is how cult recruitment starts. First it’s garlands, next thing you know you’re chanting about the moon.

**AELLA**  
(throws him a look, breathless)  
Not everything’s a cult, Z.

A reveler pats Zadie on the back, pressing another drink into his hand. Zadie takes it without hesitation, sips, winces.

**ZADIE**  
(holding it up like a specimen)  
Yep. Definitely moon juice.

The crowd surges, laughing, cheering at nothing in particular. Someone climbs a chair to wave a neon scarf. A man in a glitter vest spins with a child’s kite overhead, like it belongs there.

AELLA is in it — not performing, just soaking it up, alive in the noise. She drifts through, brushing hands, swapping grins.

Zadie trails behind, slower, less open, but watching everything. Sunglasses hide his eyes but not his smirk.

**ZADIE**  
(to himself, amused)  
Spring break for immortals.

AELLA darts back to him, breathless.

**AELLA**  
You’re missing it.

**ZADIE**  
I see it. That’s enough.

**AELLA**  
You’re impossible.

She pulls his arm, playful. He doesn’t resist.

Someone with a face streaked in paint holds out a tambourine. Aella takes it, bangs it twice, hands it off like a dare. Zadie shakes his head — then, at the last second, taps it once with a fingertip before shoving it back.

The crowd CHEERS like he’s performed a miracle. Zadie bows theatrically, deadpan.

**ZADIE**  
(to Aella)  
See? Instant prophet. Your move.

Aella shoves him, laughing.

**AELLA**  
You’re an idiot.

The two push deeper into the room, swallowed by noise and light.

A woman draped in yellow scarves stops them both, pressing petals into their palms. She looks at them with too much intensity, as if they’re honored guests.

**WOMAN**  
You belong here.

Aella beams, closes her fist around the petals. Zadie rolls his eyes — but tucks them into his pocket.

**AELLA**  
(tugging him onward)  
Come on. Just… feel it.

**ZADIE**  
I am feeling it. I feel a rash forming.

She spins again, laughing. He shakes his head, smiling despite himself, and follows her deeper.

**WIDE SHOT — THE ROOM**  
Bodies swirl, neon kites cut through incense, tambourines clatter, voices rise without reason. It’s not sex, not worship, not a rave. It’s something in-between — a celebration too big for the basement it’s trapped in.

**CLOSE ON AELLA** — flushed, eyes alight.  
**CLOSE ON ZADIE** — sunglasses reflecting the chaos, grin flickering wider.

Together, they vanish into the current.

**FADE OUT.**

---

**INT. UNDERGROUND PARTY – NIGHT**

The music stops. A hush spreads, like a wave.

**A GONG.**  
Low. Resonant. The sound hangs in the air.

The crowd **cheers, laughs nervously** — then begins to part, bodies shifting, creating a circle in the middle of the floor.

A figure emerges. **MATTY.** Tall, sequined jacket catching the light, his face lit with an intensity that borders on feverish. Every eye follows him.

Beside him, a WOMAN draped in scarves moves with deliberate grace. She lowers herself to the floor at the center of the circle, kneeling, facing away from him. Her eyes close. A faint, calm smile flickers across her face — as if she’s preparing for something inevitable.

The crowd falls silent.

Matty steps forward, deliberate. He clasps something in his hands, hidden, pressed to his chest. Crossed arms. Reverent.

**CLOSE — AELLA**  
Her breath catches. She can’t look away.

**CLOSE — ZADIE**  
A grimace. Brows drawn. This is wrong.

Matty raises his arms, slow, ritualistic, lifting the object above the woman’s head. His head tilts downward, gaze heavy.

The crowd waits. Breathless.

Silence stretches.

Then —

**MATTY**  
(soft, almost a chant)  
Turn around…

**Beat.**

**MATTY**  
(louder, breaking into melody)  
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely—

The room ERUPTS. Cheers, laughter, applause. Petals thrown. A tambourine shakes wildly.

The woman springs to her feet, spins, and claps along, grinning.

Matty belts into the microphone, whole body alive with song.

**CLOSE — AELLA**  
She exhales, half-laugh, half-shock, shoulders trembling.

**CLOSE — ZADIE**  
His grimace melts into disbelief. Then a crooked grin.

The crowd surges forward, swept into the chorus. Firecrackers pop. The space transforms back into chaos and joy, as if the silence never happened.
