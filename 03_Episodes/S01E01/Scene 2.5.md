**REXUS** (still watching the stage)  
Not just... be with her.

(pause)

I mean really stay.

(pause)

She used to cry at sunsets.

(He finally looks away from the stage, at his hands.)

Not sad. Just... overwhelmed. Said she only had thirty thousand left. Maybe.

(beat)

Thirty thousand sunsets and she treated each one like it was the last.

I wanted what she had. That... weight. Where things _matter_ because they're slipping away.

(pause, looking back at the stage)

I'm sitting here right now, not even watching. I've seen this opera forty times. Fifty. The soprano hits the same notes and I feel... nothing.

(quieter)

That's what infinity does. It flattens everything.

(He stops. Shakes his head.)

I thought—what if I just become like her? What if I stop being... this?

**LUCIAN**  
You wanted to be mortal.

(He stops. Looks at Lucian.)

**REXUS**(He stops. Looks at Lucian.)
I don't even know if the Architect would allow that. Can we change what we are? Did He make us... fixed?

**LUCIAN** (careful)  
I don't know.

**REXUS**  
Nope. Neither do I.

(He looks back at the stage. The music swells.)

I saw it coming. The fault line. Fifty years out, I could see the stress building.

(beat)

You would've seen it earlier. A hundred years, probably. Seen the whole cascade.

(pause)

But even if I'd seen it sooner... could I have stopped it? Or was she always going to die no matter what I did?

(His voice tightens.)

The Pattern doesn't care how much you love someone.

**LUCIAN**  
Rexus...

**REXUS** (not stopping)  
Charlotte reminded me of her. Not just the smile. The recklessness. Choosing the wrong guy because it's more interesting.

(beat)

An eternity of existence and I'm still playing the same fucking game. Still drawn to the same type.

(pause)

Taresh died and I learned nothing.

(Silence. The opera continues below. Rexus stares at nothing.)

Lucian doesn't say anything.

He just reaches over. Places his hand on Rexus' shoulder. Steady. Grounding.

Rexus looks up. Meets his eyes.

A look passes between them—_I'm good. Thank you._

(Beat.)

Rexus picks up his glass. Drains it.

Smiles.

**REXUS**  
Let's get the fuck out of here, dude.

Lucian smiles back. Takes a final sip of his champagne.

**LUCIAN**  
Let's do it.

He sets his half-full glass down.

Rexus grabs it. Chugs that too.

Lucian laughs.

They stand. Head for the exit.

The opera continues below—oblivious.
