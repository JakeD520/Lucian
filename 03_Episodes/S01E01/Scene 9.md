### **Scene 9 – Plushie Paradise (continued)**

**FADE IN:**

**CLOSE ON** _Evander’s face — smoke curling, eyes soft with thought._

A YOUNG WOMAN (20s, radiant, mischievous) lies across his chest, skin on skin amid a riot of plush toys. Her leg drapes over him lazily.

She studies him for a long moment, tracing idle circles on his ribs.

**WOMAN**  
You talk like a poet who got bored of hearing himself.  
(sly smile)  
You ever stop thinking and just… float?

Evander grins faintly, eyes half-lidded.  
She giggles, then rummages into the mountain of plushies beside her. A small glittery purse emerges.

**WOMAN (cont’d)**  
I have something for that.

She opens the purse, fishes out a tiny strip of LSD tabs, the edges catching neon light from somewhere unseen.

**WOMAN (teasing)**  
When’s the last time you saw God?

Evander chuckles, deep and slow. Her tone is a joke — his answer isn’t.

**EVANDER**  
Well… my dear…  
(beat, eyes far away)  
I suppose it’s been quite a while.

Their eyes meet — hers curious, his remembering.  
She laughs softly, tears off two tabs.

**WOMAN**  
Open up, sexy.

Evander obeys with amused grace.  
She places a tab gently on his tongue — and then another on her own.

She sinks back onto his chest. Silence. The plush world seems to pulse with their breathing.

**WOMAN**  
What does the Divine look like to you?

Evander exhales through a smile, searching his memory — not metaphor, but memory.

**EVANDER**  
Hmm…  
(beat, quiet)  
Very much like me, I suppose.  
(then, softly amused)  
As fathers and sons often do.

She chuckles, thinking it’s a line.

**WOMAN**  
You close with your family?

Evander takes a slow breath, eyes unfocused — a thousand years of something flickering behind them.

**EVANDER**  
Yes.  
(beat)  
I believe so.  
We’ve spent… well… it seems like forever together.

The woman grins, charmed by what she thinks is stoner poetry. She presses a soft kiss to his chest.

**WOMAN**  
Tell me about them.

Evander’s eyes drift upward, the smoke haloing him like memory.

**EVANDER**  
There are nine of us.  
Three brothers, four sisters…  
(beat, faint grin)  
And one who prefers to be both.

The woman’s eyebrows lift — impressed, amused.

**WOMAN**  
That’s… complicated.

**EVANDER**  
Most families are.  
(beat, soft smile)  
Ours just… takes longer to get through dinner.

She laughs, nestling back against him.  

**WOMAN**  
Your mother?

Evander pauses. His fingers still, the smoke curling slowly upward.

**EVANDER**  
Well… I don’t remember having a mother at all.  
(beat)  
I hardly remember my father.

She frowns — exaggerated, sweetly drunk empathy. Her palm rubs slow circles on his chest.

**WOMAN**  
Boo, that’s so sad.  
I’m sure they had their reasons.  
(beat, earnest)  
How are you with that?

Evander smiles faintly, as if the question itself is adorable in its smallness.

**EVANDER**  
I don’t give it much thought.  
I have a good life.  
Things to keep me occupied.

Another WOMAN, also nude, strolls lazily past the plushie pile. Her skin glows in the colored light. She catches Evander’s gaze, smiles with a mischief that lingers a second too long, then drifts off toward a laughing group of revelers in the corner.

Evander watches her go.

**WOMAN (on Evander)**  
That’s such a good attitude.  
Like… when life gives you lemons, right?

Evander chuckles — low, genuine, ancient.

**EVANDER**  
Yes.  
Something like that.

**EVANDER**  
Yes.  
Something like that.

They lie there a moment, her head rising and falling with his breathing. The muffled laughter of others filters through the plush landscape — distant, harmless.

**WOMAN**  
You know, I used to think I’d have it all figured out by now.  
(beat)  
Like there was going to be a day where I’d wake up and just… _know._  
Who I was. What I wanted.  
But every time I think I’m close, it just… shifts again.  
Like the goalpost moves when I’m not looking.

Evander listens quietly, eyes half-closed.

**WOMAN (cont’d)**  
My mom says that’s what growing up is.  
But I don’t think she ever stopped pretending she knew either.

Evander smiles faintly — not unkind, just knowing.

**EVANDER**  
Most people spend their lives convincing themselves the ground is solid.  
They build names, routines, families — anything that feels still.  
(beat)  
But the floor always moves, eventually.

She studies him, curious.

**WOMAN**  
You sound like you’ve been through it.  
Was there ever a time you didn’t know who you were?

He considers. The pause is long, but not uncomfortable.

**EVANDER**  
Once.  
Long ago.  
When I thought being alive meant belonging somewhere.

Her gaze softens; she’s moved but doesn’t quite understand.

**WOMAN**  
And now?

**EVANDER**  
Now I think belonging’s just another way of saying _afraid to leave._

She chuckles softly, half-confused, half-impressed.

**WOMAN**  
You’re kind of impossible, you know that?  
Every answer just raises three more questions.

**EVANDER**  
Then perhaps we’re making progress.

She laughs, presses a lazy kiss to his collarbone, and sighs — a genuine, grounded sound.

**WOMAN**  
Sometimes I wish I could turn my brain off.  
Stop worrying about rent and exes and if I said the wrong thing to someone at brunch.  
Just… _exist._

**EVANDER**  
You already do.  
You just keep remembering you’re supposed to be someone.

She tilts her head up toward him, eyes shining — something between flirtation and awe.

**WOMAN**  
You make that sound easy.

**EVANDER**  
It isn’t.  
But neither is pretending.

A small silence settles — soft, magnetic. The background laughter swells for a moment, then fades again.

She traces a line down his chest, thoughtful.

**WOMAN**  
You really don’t remember your father?

**EVANDER**  
Bits. A voice. A presence. A weight.  
He was… large. Not in size — in meaning.  
Everything else just seemed smaller next to him.

She nods, quietly absorbing it.

Another laugh rings out nearby — **the other woman** drifting closer now, curiosity and mischief in her eyes.

**INT. EVANDER'S LOFT – CONTINUOUS**

The scene shifts to a softer glow. Evander reclines on plush cushions, Jennifer draped across his chest, her fingers tracing lazy patterns on his skin. The ambient music pulses gently.

A WOMAN approaches from the shadows — **MANDY**, mid-twenties, confident stride. She settles onto the cushions opposite Jennifer, completing the triangle.

**MANDY**  
Hi. I'm Mandy.  
(smiles, appraising)  
You two look amazing.

Evander and Jennifer chuckle, exchanging a glance.

**EVANDER**  
Well, Mandy... I'm Evander, and this perfect slice of life you see here is Jennifer.

**MANDY** (sultry)  
Jennifer...

Jennifer looks up from Evander's chest, eyes half-lidded, pupils dilated.

**JENNIFER** (lustily)  
Hi yourself...

The drugs are starting to hit. Time feels slower, warmer.

Mandy leans down, kisses Jennifer lightly. Jennifer leans in, closes her eyes, surrendering to the moment.

A smile spreads slowly across Evander's face.

Jennifer's kiss moves to Evander — slow, deliberate. They kiss deeply. Then she begins her descent, kissing down his chest. Mandy moves up, lips finding Evander's mouth as Jennifer continues lower, passionately kissing down his body until she moves OUT OF FRAME.

Evander leans back in ecstasy, eyes closed.

Mandy smiles against his lips. She begins her own kissing descent — neck, chest, lower — until she too disappears OUT OF FRAME.

We hold on Evander's face. Pleasure washes over him in waves. His breath catches.

He turns his head to the side.

His eyes land on a plushie rhinoceros perched on the cushions beside him, seemingly staring at him through jeweled button eyes.

Evander laughs — a genuine, delighted sound. A beat.

He reaches out, gently covers the rhino's eyes with his hand.

**EVANDER** (chuckling)  
No peeking...

He closes his eyes, head falling back against the cushions as the drugs and pleasure take him over.

FADE TO BLACK.
