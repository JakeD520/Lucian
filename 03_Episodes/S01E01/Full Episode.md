INT. SERIM GALLERY – TIMELESS

**ECU – BAYEUX TAPESTRY.**  Threads shimmer, unmoving.  Total silence.
(Hold)

**ECU – KAELARYS’ EYES.**
A faint reflection of light flickers across her iris.
(Hold)
She doesn’t blink.

**CUT TO – TAPESTRY SEGMENTS:**

– **HALLEY’S COMET**
   *SFX: low wind rising — a breath that builds into a distant whoosh, like atmosphere breaking.*
   The stitched star blazes above.  Mortals point skyward, terrified.
   (Hold, The wind fades.)

– **EDWARD’S FUNERAL**
   *SFX: muffled sobbing, cloth rustle, one church bell toll.*
   The draped body lies still.  Mourners bend, faces lost in thread.
   (Hold, The bell’s ring dies out in reverb.)

– **BURNING HOMES**
   *SFX: crackling fire, timbers snapping, distant screams of women and children.*
   Soldiers drive them out; smoke threads through the embroidery.
   (Hold,. Screams taper to embers hissing.)

**PULL BACK – WIDE**
The sounds collapse into silence as the full tapestry fills the frame.
Marble.  Light.  Perfect stillness.
Only Kaelarys stands before it.

Kaelarys stands before it. Arms crossed. Regal. A portrait of control.  

(SILENCE. We let it breathe. 10 seconds too long.)  

Then—**A HUM.**  
Low. Cheerful.  
(HOLD — the note curls through the stillness, fragile but persistent.)  

Kaelarys blinks. Her eyes shift, as if awakened from deep thought.  

She turns, slightly.  

**ACROSS THE GALLERY: LYRA.**  
A silhouette first, drifting. Wide shot — let her arrive slowly.  
Earth-toned layers. Bare feet. Tattoos like constellations.  
She hums as she moves, hand hovering above the tapestry, close but untouching.  

(HOLD — CU on her hand suspended over thread.)  

She stops before a panel of carnage.  

**LYRA** (soft, barely above breath)  
They were grieving.  

(HOLD. Silence after. Kaelarys absorbs it without movement.)  

**KAELARYS** (controlled, almost brittle)  
Grieving?  

Lyra lifts her eyes. Warm. The opposite of Kaelarys’ precision.  

**LYRA**  
Every stitch is mourning.  

(HOLD. Kaelarys’ eyes shift.)  

**KAELARYS**  
Enlighten me. What do you see in their mourning?  

(SLIGHT ACCELERATION — Lyra steps closer, but still soft.)  

**LYRA**  
Look here.  
(her hand drifts above uneven threads)  
The pulls tighten in the battles. The embroiderers’ hands were trembling. Not clumsy. Remembering.  
They stitched their own wounds into history.  

**CUTAWAY – ECU THREADS. Pulled taut. Imperfect. Echoed across panels.**  
SFX: Moans, swords clashing.  Battle sounds.
(HOLD — let the fabric itself speak.)  

**KAELARYS**  
Flaws, I thought.  

**LYRA** (softer still)  
Saxon women, forced to embroider their defeat. To make beauty of their own undoing.  

Kaelarys moves her arms behind her back.  
(HOLD — silence between them, stretched.)  

**KAELARYS** (measured)  
You were made for this — attuned to currents others overlook. The Architect gave you that resonance.  

Lyra, patient.  (HOLD)

She turns to Kaelarys.

**LYRA**  
And you, Kaelarys? What was your frequency meant to be?  

**ECU**: Kaelarys - looking inward. Eyes scanning.  
(HOLD — almost too long.)  

**KAELARYS** (quiet)  
I protect what must not be lost. I ensure... what is created endures.  
Even when the creator is gone.

WIDE SHOT: The entire tapestry, Alone... juxtaposed against the quiet, perfect setting of the gallery.

Kaelarys glances at Lyra.
(HOLD. Subtext clear. She is not just speaking of artifacts.)  

Lyra studies her in silence, reading the unspoken.)  

A slow, knowing smile curves across Lyra’s face.  
She steps closer, a sudden move, clashing with the softness.  

**LYRA** (playful, with a mischievous glint)  
You look beautiful.  

Kaelarys blinks, the compliment, and energy breaking the tension.  

**KAELARYS** (low, warning)  
Lyra…  

**LYRA** (insistent, whisper-light)  
Truly. Regal. Untouchable.  Like marble.
(beat, teasing)  
Pretty marble.  

Kaelarys exhales — and this time, it breaks.  
Her lips twitch, then curve into a reluctant smirk.  

**KAELARYS** (dry, amused despite herself)  
Really? Marble?  

Lyra beams, triumphant. She steps in closer, slipping her arms around Kaelarys in a sudden, unguarded sisterly hug.  

Kaelarys stiffens for a fraction of a beat — then releases, allowing herself to be held.  
The smirk lingers, softening into something rarer: a true smile.  

(HOLD — the two of them, pressed together in quiet, the tapestry looming behind. Stone and song, finally touching.)  

Lyra tilts her head against Kaelarys’ shoulder, still smiling.

Kaelarys raises her arms, holding them against Lyra's.

Lyra grins, emboldened. 

**LYRA**
Dance with me.

She steps back, takes Kaelarys' hands, trying to coax her into a slow spin.  
Kaelarys resists, stiff, indulgent at best.

**KAELARYS** (deadpan)  
Lyra…

**LYRA** (playful)  
Just for a moment. Move with me.

Lyra twirls, fabrics sweeping, humming softly—then she leans back, arms spreading, eyes closing.  
Letting the gallery hold her. Trusting the space.

She leans too far.

Kaelarys catches her immediately—firm hand between her shoulder blades, the other steadying her arm.  
(HOLD. They stay suspended there, Lyra tilted back, Kaelarys grounding her.)

Lyra opens her eyes, laughs—delighted, not sheepish.

**LYRA** (soft, certain)  
Protector. Preserver. Even of me.

(HOLD. The truth vibrates in the silence.  
Kaelarys’ expression shifts; she cannot deny it.)  

**KAELARYS**  
(quiet, certain)  
That’s what He wanted of me—

A beat.  The conviction holds.  
Her gaze drifts — not away, just inward.  
Something subtle passes through her expression; the thought arrives, uninvited.

**KAELARYS**  
(softer, to herself)  
...I think.

She exhales.  The tension in her hands eases.  
She steadies Lyra upright and lets go, a fraction too slow.

(HOLD. Her words settle heavy in the air. A breath too long.)  

Lyra stays close, smiling — then  eases back, drifting as though unbothered.  
(HOLD. Fabrics trailing, her hair wisping.)  

She turns, almost twirling, then half-laughs to herself.  

**LYRA** (teasing, light, almost absentminded)  
I'm not even sure what He wants from us anymore.  
(beat, playful)  
Maybe I'm meant to be YOUR protector, pretty marble statue.

Her soft laugh spills into a hum, dissolving into melody as she drifts away.  

(HOLD. Kaelarys watches.  
Her face tightens.)

Lyra's hum fades into the distance, swallowed by the gallery's vastness.

Kaelarys turns back to the tapestry—but her eyes drift.

She glances toward Lyra across the gallery. Distant now. Still humming.

(HOLD. Kaelarys' expression—concern, unsure.)

Her gaze lingers. Then slowly, she looks back to the tapestry.

**CUT TO: ECU – THE TAPESTRY'S EDGE.**

The embroidery stops abruptly. Mid-battle.  
Loose threads dangle, unfinished. Fraying.

(HOLD.)

**FADE TO BLACK.**

**The Opening Structure:**

**FADE IN:**

**EXT. ROYAL OPERA HOUSE – NIGHT**

London. Grand architecture. Patrons in gowns and tuxedos ascending the steps.

Wealth. Status. Ceremony.

**INT. ROYAL OPERA HOUSE – LOBBY – CONTINUOUS**

Marble. Chandeliers. Champagne flutes on silver trays.

Hushed, reverent conversation. Programs rustling.

**INT. MAIN AUDITORIUM – CONTINUOUS**

Five tiers of balconies. Gold leaf everywhere. A sea of faces upturned toward the stage.

The lights dim. Silence falls.

**ON STAGE:**

The curtain rises. _La Traviata_, Act III.

VIOLETTA lies in bed, pale, dying. The set is opulent but muted—wealth unable to stop death.

The soprano begins—**"Addio del passato"** (Farewell to the past).

Her voice: fragile, beautiful, breaking.

**HOLD on the performance. Let it breathe. The audience is transfixed.**

_"Addio del passato bei sogni ridenti..."_  
(Farewell, happy dreams of the past...)

The strings swell beneath her. Grief made sound.

**PULL BACK—through the rapt faces, up through the tiers...**

**TO: SKYBOX – TOP TIER**

LUCIAN and REXUS.

Handsome. Tailored suits—but Rexus' tie is loosened, top button undone. Lucian's posture is too relaxed, one arm draped over the back of his chair.

They look like they wandered into a wedding reception and decided to stay.

Champagne glasses. Rexus has his feet propped on the railing (scandalous).

They're watching the stage—but casually. Like you'd watch a rerun of a show you love.

The soprano's voice fills the space.

_"Le mie grazie... cadute... avvizzite..."_  
(My charms... fallen... withered...)

Rexus tilts his head slightly. Appreciative.

**REXUS** (quiet, to Lucian)  
She's good.

**LUCIAN** (not looking away from the stage)  
Better than last season.

They settle back. Comfortable. The opera continues.

**In the neighboring box:**

CHARLOTTE, mid-20s, beautiful, polished. Expensive but understated dress. She's trying to look engaged with the opera but is clearly... a little bored.

Next to her: MARSHALL, 40s, sharp suit, sharper eyes. He's not watching the opera—he's watching _her_. And scanning the room.

Rexus notices Charlotte. Grins.

**REXUS** (to Lucian, low)  
That's the Transport Minister's daughter.

**LUCIAN** (barely glancing over)  
You're not her type.

**REXUS**  
I'm everyone's type.

He catches her eye. Holds it.

Charlotte smiles—quick, then looks away. But she looks back.

Marshall notices immediately. His jaw tightens.

(The opera continues. The soprano's voice tender, building.)

Rexus raises his champagne glass toward Charlotte—subtle, just for her.

She bites back a smile. Glances at Marshall, then back.

**REXUS** (to Lucian, still watching her)  
She has Taresh's smile.

**LUCIAN** (glances at him, recognizing the name)  
Taresh?

**REXUS** (grin softening, nostalgic)  
Yeah. That same... I don't know. Mischief hiding behind manners.

Charlotte tilts her head slightly—curious about him.

Rexus mouths something. She can't quite make it out, squints, smiles anyway.

**REXUS** (to Lucian, still playing)  
Taresh used to do that too. This look like she was deciding whether I was worth the trouble.

**LUCIAN**  
And?

**REXUS**  
She decided I was.

(beat)

For a while, anyway.

Marshall leans toward Charlotte, whispers something. Warning.

Charlotte nods—polite, dismissive—doesn't look away from Rexus.

**REXUS** (watching, amused)  
Her people had these... advisors too. Elders, they called them. Always hovering. Always worried she'd make the wrong choice.

**LUCIAN**  
Did she?

**REXUS** (grin widening)  
Absolutely.

Charlotte laughs at something—maybe she caught what Rexus mouthed, maybe she's just enjoying the game.

**REXUS** (quieter, remembering)  
Taresh had this laugh. Gods, you could hear it across the whole plaza. Her father hated it—said it wasn't dignified for someone of her position.

(beat)

She didn't care.

Marshall's hand moves to Charlotte's arm now. Gentle but firm.

**REXUS** (to Lucian, watching Marshall)  
They tried to keep us apart. Thought I was... what did they call it? "Unsuitable for her station."

**LUCIAN**  
They weren't wrong.

**REXUS**  
No. But that's what made it fun.

Marshall stands now—done with subtlety. He leans down, whispers urgently to Charlotte.

Charlotte resists for a moment—one more glance at Rexus.

**REXUS** (to Lucian, quieter)  
You know, I saw this coming. The advisor, the exit. Whole thing.

**LUCIAN**  
And you did it anyway.

**REXUS**  
That's the difference between us. You see the Pattern and _accept_ it. I see it and think... what if I push here? What if I—

**LUCIAN**  
You see threads. I see the whole tapestry.

**REXUS** (grin, self-aware)  
Yeah. I can never follow it like you can, Lucian. Sure, I see it. But not like you do.

Charlotte rises. Marshall's hand on her elbow, guiding.

**REXUS** (watching her stand)  
With Taresh... I thought I could see enough. Her city, her people—I knew what was coming. Thought I had fifty years to figure it out.

Charlotte looks back one last time. Apologetic smile.

Rexus raises his glass. Playful wave.

She waves back—coy, a little regretful.

Then she's gone.

**REXUS** (still watching the empty doorway)  
Turns out fifty years isn't long at all.

(pause, the grin fading)

Not when you've lived eighteen million.

The opera swells. The soprano's voice fragile, breaking.

Rexus settles back in his seat. The playfulness drains.

**REXUS** (quieter now, different)  
I wanted to stay with her.

Lucian looks at him. This is new.

Rexus takes a sip of champagne.

Turns his attention to the stage.

**ON STAGE:**

Violetta lies in bed, pale, dying. Alfredo kneels beside her, taking her hand.

The music shifts—quieter now, intimate.

**VIOLETTA** (singing, fragile)  
_"È strano... è strano..."_  
(It's strange... it's strange...)

She's looking at him with something like wonder. Like she can't believe he's there. That he stayed.

**VIOLETTA** (continuing)  
_"...in ciel, in terra..."_  
(in heaven, on earth...)

Her hand reaches for his face. Touches it gently—like she's trying to memorize it.

Because she knows. She's running out of time.

**BACK TO THE SKYBOX:**

Rexus watches. Still. Silent.

His fingers tighten slightly around his champagne glass.

**ON STAGE:**

Alfredo pulls her close. Desperate. Like if he holds her tight enough, he can keep her here.

But she's already fading.

The strings swell—mournful, inevitable.

Violetta’s voice trembles through her final phrases.  
Applause swells—polite, reverent, the kind of sound that tries to smooth over death.

**IN THE SKYBOX**

Rexus doesn’t clap. He just watches the curtain fall.

Lucian studies him—knows better than to speak.

The house lights rise halfway. Murmured conversation, the rustle of programs.  
Patrons stretch, sip champagne, laugh too loudly.  
The spell breaks.

Rexus leans back, eyes on nothing.

> **REXUS**  
> They cheer a woman dying… then toast to her courage.  
> _(beat)_  
> Mortals make grief look festive.

Lucian doesn’t reply. The orchestra tunes softly below—strings sighing, cellos humming like a low tide.

A VOICE comes over the house speakers, smooth and ceremonial.

> **ANNOUNCER (V.O.)**  
> Ladies and gentlemen—our next selection,  
> from _Manon Lescaut_:  
> “**Sola, perduta, abbandonata**,”  
> performed by Giulia Ferrani.

Polite applause. Then the lights fade again—slower this time.

Rexus doesn’t move.

---

### **ON STAGE**

The curtain rises on emptiness.  
A cracked wasteland glows under amber haze.  
A single figure stands at its center—alone.

Wind machines whisper through the orchestra pit.

The soprano begins, soft but unflinching:

> **SOPRANO (O.S.)**  
> _“Sola, perduta, abbandonata in landa desolata…”_  
> _(Alone, lost, abandoned in this desolate land.)_

Her voice climbs the walls, thin as breath, enormous as memory.

---

### **IN THE SKYBOX**

Rexus exhales—barely audible.

Lucian turns; something in his brother’s face has changed.  
Stillness. Recognition.

> **REXUS**  
> (quiet, almost to himself)  
> That word…  
> _Abbandonata._

The strings deepen, the desert light bleeding across his reflection in the glass.

**HOLD** on the two of them as the aria builds—  
mortal despair echoing through divine silence.


**BACK TO REXUS:**

His jaw tightens. He doesn't look away from the stage.

(Long beat. The music fills the silence.)

**REXUS** (still watching the stage)  
Not just... be with her.

(pause)

I mean really stay.

(pause)

She used to cry at sunsets.

(He finally looks away from the stage, at his hands.)

Not sad. Just... overwhelmed. Said she only had thirty thousand left. Maybe.

(beat)

Thirty thousand sunsets and she treated each one like it was the last.

**LUCIAN**  
You've told me about her before.

**REXUS**  
Not this part.

(He takes a drink. Sets the glass down.)

I wanted what she had. That... weight. Where things _matter_ because they're slipping away.

(pause, looking back at the stage)

I'm sitting here right now, not even watching. I've seen this opera forty times. Fifty. The soprano hits the same notes and I feel... nothing.

(quieter)

That's what infinity does. It flattens everything.

(He stops. Shakes his head.)

I thought—what if I just become like her? What if I stop being... this?

**LUCIAN**  
You wanted to be mortal.

**REXUS**  
I _needed_ to understand what she felt. Waking up knowing you have limits. That your body will fail. That you'll forget things.

(pause)

It terrified me.

(beat)

But it felt real. More real than anything I'd felt in—

(He stops. Looks at Lucian.)

I don't even know if the Architect would allow that. Can we change what we are? Did He make us... fixed?

(pause)

I never asked. Never thought to ask.

**LUCIAN** (careful)  
I don't know.

**REXUS**  
No. Neither do I.

(He looks back at the stage. The music swells.)

I saw it coming. The fault line. Fifty years out, I could see the stress building.

(beat)

You would've seen it earlier. A hundred years, probably. Seen the whole cascade.

(pause)

But even if I'd seen it sooner... could I have stopped it? Or was she always going to die no matter what I did?

(His voice tightens.)

The Pattern doesn't care how much you love someone.

**LUCIAN**  
Rexus...

**REXUS** (not stopping)  
Charlotte reminded me of her. Not just the smile. The recklessness. Choosing the wrong guy because it's more interesting.

(beat)

Eighteen million years and I'm still playing the same game. Still drawn to the same type.

(pause)

Taresh died and I learned nothing.

(Silence. The opera continues below. Rexus stares at nothing.)

Lucian doesn't say anything.

He just reaches over. Places his hand on Rexus' shoulder. Steady. Grounding.

Rexus looks up. Meets his eyes.

A look passes between them—_I'm good. Thank you._

(Beat.)

Rexus picks up his glass. Drains it.

Smiles.

**REXUS**  
Let's get the fuck out of here, dude.

Lucian smiles back. Takes a final sip of his champagne.

**LUCIAN**  
Let's do it.

He sets his half-full glass down.

Rexus grabs it. Chugs that too.

Lucian laughs.

They stand. Head for the exit.

The opera continues below—oblivious.

**INT. DINER – NIGHT**

Neon hum. Grease and coffee in the air. A cracked vinyl booth cluttered with syrup bottles, half-empty mugs, a plate of pancakes going cold.

AELLA hunches over her plate. ZADIE lounges opposite, back to the window, sunglasses on even though it’s nearly midnight.

**AELLA** (poking her pancakes with her fork) You know… they never give you enough butter.

Zadie sips his coffee like champagne.

**AELLA** These things will be soup before she comes back.

She raises a hand for the WAITRESS—no dice.

**AELLA** Do you have enhanced hearing?

**ZADIE** (flat) No.

He whistles—sharp.

**ZADIE** (snapping his fingers) More butter please!

The waitress glances over, annoyed, vanishes toward the kitchen.

**AELLA** Jesus, Z. Great. Now she’s spitting in my butter.

**ZADIE** (smirk) Not gonna happen, Red. They only spit in items where the spittle can be obscured. Soup? Yup. Salad? Probably. Butter? Only a truly deranged server attempts a butter-spit. Too much surface area. No camouflage.

(Beat) She studies him like she’s closing in.

**AELLA** Do you have a pouch?

**ZADIE** (grinning) Tragically. Entirely sans pouch.

**AELLA** Fuck.

She shoves a bite in, unimpressed. He savors his coffee like it’s a retort.

**ZADIE** That’s— mm —nineteen, by the way.

Aella narrows her eyes.

**AELLA** Why the fuck are we even here, Z? What’s your thing with these divey places?

**ZADIE** (after a thoughful beat) Diners, my dear, are the last honest places in America. Stuck in this perfect amber from when conversations mattered and coffee came with refills and hope.

Aella raises an eyebrow but doesn't interrupt.

**ZADIE** You walk into one of these cathedrals at 2 a.m. and you're in a fucking Hopper painting crossed with noir—shadows, possibilities...

He nods toward their waitress.

**ZADIE** ...and a waitress with tired eyes who might accidentally change your life.

Aella lets a genuine smile slip, appreciative of his romanticizing, then looks back to her plate.

**AELLA** You know what would change my life? More butter. (beat) Do you even have hair?

**ZADIE** (raising a fist) Nope. That's a win for me!

He sips his coffee in celebration.

A prolonged moment of silence.

**AELLA** Well…

She shrugs, holding her hands out in expectation.

**ZADIE** Oh…I'm an olm. Sad blind bastard of a salamander that lives in caves and hasn't seen sunlight in like a million years. Only found in—

**AELLA** (cutting him off) What the fuck even is that, Z? That doesn’t count.

**ZADIE** Oh….it counts.

He takes another sip of his coffee, pinky out.

**AELLA** Motherfucker.

The waitress swings by, drops a tiny dish with **one** butter pat, and walks away without a word.

**AELLA** (squinting after her) See? This is your fault. One? That thing’s a postage stamp.

She spreads the lone pat with exaggerated care.

**ZADIE** One pat. No spit, though. Want me to tempt fate again?

Aella clocks a lonely PATRON at the counter, face lit by his phone, slightly turned, oblivious. A small plate of butter pats sits beside his elbow. Unloved.

**AELLA** (eyebrows up) Better idea.

Aella rises, cartoon-sneaking: knees high, arms bent like a Saturday-morning burglar. Zadie watches, amusement growing.

She _yoinks_ the plate in one smooth swipe and struts back, presenting the haul like treasure.

ZADIE (chuckling) You’re an absolute menace.

AELLA (smug) That’s called initiative, my friend.

She slathers. Eats. Little happy food-shimmy she doesn’t mean to do and absolutely does.

**AELLA** (mouth full) Okay. You go.

Zadie straightens, mock-solemn.

**ZADIE** Do you sing?

Aella freezes, then pelts him with her napkin.

**AELLA** No. Asshole. I am not—nor will I ever be—Taylor Swift.

Zadie cracks up, delighted. Clearly not the first time he's led with Swift in 20 Questions.

**ZADIE** Hey, a guy can hope. Me and my Swiftie brothers live and breathe T-Swizzle.

**AELLA** T-Swizzle my ass.

They share an easy, unguarded laugh. The Patron finally notices the missing butter, turns—too late.

**CUT TO:** neon buzzing; the low diner music carries us out.




**FADE IN:**

**EXTREME CLOSE-UP - EVANDER'S FACE**

_EVANDER (30s, deeply thoughtful eyes, the kind of face that suggests he's seen through society's illusions). He takes a slow, practiced hit from a joint, holds it with the reverence of a wine connoisseur, then exhales thoughtfully._

**EVANDER** _(voice like warm honey, tinged with smoke)_ You know what's fascinating about attachment? Not the Buddhist kind - fuck that noise for a minute - I'm talking about the primal shit. The way a person's sense of home becomes... indistinguishable from their sense of self.

_He takes another hit, eyes distant but laser-focused._

**EVANDER (CONT'D)** Think about it. Your home - whether that's a house, a neighborhood, a way of life, an ideology - it's not separate from you. It's the extended nervous system of your identity. Touch it, and you feel it. Threaten it, and every defense mechanism you've ever developed comes online.

_His fingers gesture lazily, drawing invisible connections in the air._

**EVANDER (CONT'D)** The suburbanite who calls the cops on kids skating in "his" parking lot. The activist who doxxes people for using the wrong pronouns. The patriot who bombs abortion clinics. The liberal who tries to get people fired for old tweets. Different tribes, same fucking circuit firing.

_He pauses, studying the joint like it contains cosmic wisdom._

**EVANDER (CONT'D)** See, here's where it gets beautiful and terrifying at the same time. Each person deploys whatever weapons they've got access to. The physically strong resort to violence - it's efficient, direct, monkey-brain simple. The socially connected become bullies, use shame and ostracism like a medieval siege. The intellectually gifted will use their wits to outsmart.

_He chuckles, a sound both amused and slightly disturbed._

**EVANDER (CONT'D)** It's never about hatred, you see. It's always about love. Love so fierce, so territorial, so confused with identity that it becomes indistinguishable from violence. They're not monsters - that would be easier to understand. They're people protecting extensions of themselves with the same desperate urgency they'd protect their own children.

(He looks past camera, almost tender.)

_Another thoughtful drag._

**EVANDER (CONT'D)** And the wildest part? They're not wrong to feel righteous. From their perspective, they are literally protecting their extended self from annihilation. When someone threatens your home - your physical, psychological, ideological home - you're not experiencing it as an attack on some external thing. You're experiencing it as death.

_His voice drops to almost a whisper, but remains perfectly clear._

**EVANDER (CONT'D)** So they fight like their lives depend on it. Because, in a very real sense, they do. The version of themselves that depends on that particular configuration of home - it really would die if they didn't fight.

_He closes his eyes for a moment, as if integrating some profound realization._

_A beat of silence._

**VOICE (O.S.)** _(confused, slightly stoned)_ So... like... you're saying that Jerry was the good guy? Tom was the asshole?

_PULL BACK TO REVEAL:_

**WIDE SHOT - PLUSHIE PARADISE**

_EVANDER, completely nude, sprawled luxuriously in what can only be described as a sea of plush toys - teddy bears, unicorns, cartoon characters, an entire ecosystem of soft, colorful comfort. A YOUNG WOMAN, also nude (20s, beautiful, uninhibited) has her head on his chest, her leg draped across his groin with casual intimacy._

_Evander lowers the joint toward her. She takes a drag with practiced ease._

_Nearby, another COUPLE lies among the plushies - the MAN strategically covering himself with what appears to be a large elephant plush toy, while his FEMALE PARTNER lies on her back, completely unselfconscious in her nudity._

_The entire scene is surreal, philosophical - like if Alan Watts had been reborn as a hedonistic guru in a toy store._

**_NAKED WOMAN NEXT TO ELEPHANT GUY_** _No, he's saying that the cat was protecting his home from the mouse, dude._

_The man next to her perks…his eyes searching his thoughts for clarity._

**_WOMAN DRAPED ACROSS EVANDER_** _So, which one was right, Van? Tom or Jerry?_

_Evander takes a hit from the joint. He holds it like a pro, exhales slowly._

_(beat)_

**_EVANDER_** _Exactly, my lovely._

**_FADE OUT._**

**INT. NIGHTCLUB – VIP BOOTH**

The club floor is chaos — bodies in strobe-light seizure, bass rolling like thunder under the skin.

At the far wall, behind a velvet rope and a black-suited bouncer, a **VIP booth** rises like an island. Leather curves in a half-circle, a low table gleaming with bottles, glasses, ice buckets.

**VAL** reclines at the center — androgynous chic, tailored perfection, every angle catching the light differently with each strobe. To the left, masculine edge in the line of jaw and lean frame. To the right, feminine elegance in the curve of hand, cascade of hair. Eyes predatory, amused, restless.

Around them, an **entourage** — sycophants, lovers, courtiers in all but name. Laughter too loud, gestures too rehearsed, as though each is auditioning to stay in orbit.

But Val is detached. The glass dangles loosely in their fingers. They sip without tasting. Their gaze drifts over the crowd, scanning like a sovereign who’s seen this procession a thousand nights.

_Every smile looks recycled. Every dance step, choreographed. Every laugh, the same as last night’s laugh._

**VAL** ( in expression) The masque repeats. Different masks, same faces.

_The entourage roars at some joke. Val doesn’t. They smile faintly, but the eyes say it clearly: boredom._

The bass swells. The **INTRUDER** enters frame.

The BOUNCER straightens, then relaxes. He knows this man. Everyone does. Tall. Tailored. Smile polished like chrome. A WOMAN clings to his arm, radiant, lacquered in the sheen of money well-spent.

They exchange a clasp at the rope — old familiarity. The man leans in, voice low, a conspiratorial murmur. A folded pair of hundreds slip from hand to hand with practiced ease.

Not so subtle. Not to VAL’s eyes.

VAL watches, glass halfway to their lips. A faint narrowing — irritation? amusement? Hard to tell.

The rope opens. The man steps through without hesitation, as though expected, as though this space were his second home. The entourage hardly notices.

He slides into the booth opposite Val, the woman tucked neatly against his side. Comfortable. Confident. Certain.

**INTRUDER** (pleasant, declarative) This is the best seat in the house. Thought I’d join you.

The entourage titter — some notice the new faces, some oblivious. The man lets the line hang, expecting his reputation to do the rest.

VAL’s eyes linger. A squint, tiny, surgical. Then… the smile. Slow. Dangerous.

At last, something to do.

**INTRUDER** (to Val, easy) I’d have remembered seeing you here before. You’re not the sort to blend.

_Val arches a brow, not flattered but entertained. They sip, eyes locked._

**VAL** And you’re not the sort to miss anyone worth remembering.

_The INTRUDER smiles at that, appreciative — not many return his serve with precision. He leans in a little, lowering his voice so it cuts through the music._

**INTRUDER** I make it a point to know everyone who matters in a room. You? You matter.

_VAL lets the words hang, then laughs softly — not dismissive, but genuinely pleased. They tip their glass toward him._

**VAL** How refreshing. Most men recite their triumphs. You lead with recognition.

**INTRUDER** Recognition is the triumph. The rest is chatter.

_VAL nods slowly, savoring the line. They like this man. They could like him a lot._

**VAL** (leaning forward, conspiratorial) Then consider yourself recognized.

_The INTRUDER grins, raising his glass. They clink, eyes steady. For a beat, it’s not adversarial at all. It’s possibility. Two sovereigns meeting on neutral ground, enjoying the game for its own sake._

**INT. SERIM GALLERY – TIMELESS**

The Bayeux Tapestry looms. Threads shimmer under timeless light. **Lyra** twirls beneath it, skirts sweeping like a brushstroke. She slows, breathless, eyes locked on the embroidery.

(HOLD. The echo of her spin fades.)

**LYRA**  
Why do we keep these here, anyway? Why in Serim?

**KAELARYS**  
_(fond, almost rote)_  
We always have. We capture creations at the pinnacle of their being… when they most fully embody their creator's vision.

(HOLD. Kaelarys' voice lingers against the silence.)

**LYRA**  
The pinnacle?  
_(beat, her tone light, thoughtful)_  
But on Earth, this tapestry is faded. Patched, even reworked. Isn't that still art? Doesn't the decay add to it? The stains, the wear… aren't those part of the story?

(HOLD. CU: Kaelarys. A flicker of surprise. She didn't expect the question.)

**KAELARYS**  
Decay can reveal beauty, yes…  
_(beat)_  
But the vision—the spark that began it—that is what we preserve. The moment it became whole.

**LYRA**  
When the creator has moved on?

(HOLD. Silence stretches. Kaelarys stiffens. CU: her eyes flicker—something sharp, painful. An intrusive thought.)

She forces a small smile, brushing it aside.

**KAELARYS**  
…Well. Yes. In a way. When the vision is complete, it's left to endure.  
_(beat — her voice softer, but there's tension underneath.)_

**LYRA**  
_(playful, testing)_  
Do you ever wonder… if I painted something? Or if you sculpted a statue? Would we display it here?

(HOLD. Kaelarys' smile falters. The silence answers first.)

**KAELARYS**  
_(quiet, but firm)_  
That's not what we do, Lyra.

(HOLD. Lyra absorbs it. Her playfulness ebbs away.)

**LYRA**  
The humans fill their world with works—paintings, poems, cathedrals.  
_(beat, voice dipping)_  
And us… nothing.

She turns slightly, catching her reflection on the marble floor.

**LYRA**  
Funny, isn't it? Everything about me screams 'artist.'

(HOLD. She spins the charm at her neck, glances down at tattoos, fabrics, wild hair. She laughs softly—uncertain, not joyous.)

**LYRA**  
But none of it is mine. The style, the ink, the songs I hum… all borrowed. From them.  
_(beat — quieter, her voice catching)_  
It's like I'm only wearing the mask. Pretending to be what I can never really be.

Her eyes glisten. She presses her hand into her palm, nails biting.

(HOLD. Kaelarys watches, face softening.)

Kaelarys steps closer, slow, deliberate. She takes Lyra's hand, pries the fingers open gently, and traces the **star tattoo** there.

(HOLD. Her thumb moves in slow circles. CU: Lyra's breath trembling.)

**KAELARYS**  
Oh, no, Lyra… don't you see?  
_(beat — her voice low, steady, intimate)_  
You are not only a creator.  
_(she meets her sister's eyes)_  
You are creation.

(HOLD. Lyra's lips part. She doesn't pull away. For the first time, she lets Kaelarys hold her.)

**KAELARYS**  
_(she glances up at the tapestry, then back to Lyra)_  
Do you think these embroiderers spun the wool?  
_(beat — a faint smile, tender)_  
Do you think they harvested the madder root for red, the weld for gold?

She gestures softly to the tapestry.

**KAELARYS** _(cont'd)_  
Do you think Bishop Odo rode into battle? Swung the sword? Burned the villages?

_(beat — softer now, tracing the tattoo on Lyra's palm)_  
No. They worked with what already was. Wool. Dye. Blood. Memory…  
_(her eyes lift to the embroidery)_  
…and shaped something that endures.

(HOLD. Silence. Then—Kaelarys' voice drops.)

**KAELARYS** _(cont'd)_  
Every stitch here—  
_(she releases Lyra's hand, gestures to a panel)_  
—is a window. A window to the soul of whoever pulled that thread.

_(beat)_  
But it's more than that.

She steps closer to the tapestry, eyes scanning the embroidery.

**KAELARYS** _(cont'd)_  
When we stand before art, we don't just see the maker.  
_(she turns back to Lyra)_  
We see ourselves.

(HOLD. Lyra watches, listening.)

**KAELARYS** _(cont'd)_  
You saw grief in these stitches. Trembling hands. Saxon women mourning.  
_(beat, softer)_  
I see precision. Discipline. The refusal to let memory die.

_(she gestures between them)_  
Two souls, looking at the same threads... and finding different truths.

**KAELARYS** _(cont'd)_  
That's the gift of creation, Lyra. It doesn't just reveal the maker—  
_(beat)_  
—it reveals the one who receives it.

(HOLD. Her voice drops, almost reverent.)

**KAELARYS** _(cont'd)_  
Art is a conversation across time. Across worlds.  
_(she looks back at the tapestry)_  
The embroiderer speaks. Bishop Odo speaks. The wool, the blood, the battle—they all speak.

_(she meets Lyra's eyes)_  
And when you look... _you_ speak back.

(HOLD.)

**KAELARYS** _(cont'd)_  
What you see in art—what moves you, what haunts you—  
_(quieter)_  
That is you, Lyra. Your soul, answering theirs.

(HOLD. She releases Lyra's hand, but the trace of her touch lingers.)

**KAELARYS** _(cont'd)_  
That's why it matters. Not because it's new, but because it speaks. Because it connects.

Lyra looks back to the tapestry.

**LYRA**  
_(soft, almost to herself)_  
And if I am art… then so are you. So are all of us.

(HOLD. Kaelarys watches her. The words settle. Almost prayerful.)

**FADE.**



**INT. ROYAL OPERA HOUSE – GRAND CORRIDOR – NIGHT**

Marble underfoot. Velvet-lined walls. The echo of the aria still rolling. Lucian and Rexus walk side by side—figures cut from the same fabric as the building itself: poised, untouchable.

They pass gilded doors, portraits of patrons, ushers at perfect stillness. Every detail curated, immaculate.

Then—up ahead—a STAFF DOOR. Plain. Functional. A woman in blacks appears, moving briskly. She swipes a badge, slips inside without breaking stride. The door swings back on its hinge—about to shut.

Rexus glances at Lucian, then casually plants his foot against the frame, stopping it cold.

Lucian raises a brow.

**LUCIAN** Really.

**REXUS** (half-grin) If we only walk the halls they give us, we’ll never see what’s worth stealing.

He eases the door open. The golden light of the corridor spills into shadowed concrete.

Lucian hesitates just a breath, then follows him through.

**INT. BACK-OF-HOUSE – SERVICE CORRIDOR – NIGHT**

The shift is instant. Velvet and marble give way to raw plaster, exposed pipes, the hum of machinery. The air smells faintly of dust and rosin. Fluorescents buzz overhead, casting everything in stark, unflattering light.

They move past stacked flight cases, wheeled risers, signage taped to the wall in Sharpie: **“ACT II – STAGE LEFT”**, **“COSTUMES TO GREEN ROOM.”**

Rexus runs a hand across a battered trunk as they pass, grinning like a boy on a dare.

Lucian takes it all in—calm, absorbing.

They reach another door, half ajar. Rexus pulls it open wider—The two enter.

**INT. PROP WORKSHOP – NIGHT**

Fluorescents buzz awake. Long benches stretch across the space, cluttered with tools, brushes, and half-finished props. Racks brim with swords, rifles, mannequins in half-stitched gowns. The faint echo of the aria bleeds through the walls.

Rexus steps in first, eyes bright.

He strolls along one of the benches, running his hand over unfinished crowns, a drying pistol, the frame of a chandelier waiting for glass. He picks things up, sets them down again, like a kid in someone else’s toybox.

**REXUS** (natural, without looking back) Nice to see you out of Serim for once.

Lucian stands a few paces back, still at the threshold. Watching.

Lucian steps further in, gaze drifting across the benches — half-painted props, sabres on a rack, a mask drying in resin.

**LUCIAN** Yeah. I’ve been doing a lot of… thinking.

Lucian picks up a prop sabre, turns it idly in his hand.

Rexus looks up from the workbench. His mouth starts to open — a question hanging there — then he stops himself. Closes it. He studies Lucian instead, fingers tapping lightly against a discarded crown.

A long beat.

Finally, Rexus exhales, voice softer than usual.

**REXUS** I’ve noticed you and Lyra have been spending a lot of time together.

Lucian pauses. The silence stretches — a little longer than comfortable. His grip tightens slightly on the sabre in his hand.

When he speaks, it’s slower, more deliberate than usual.

**LUCIAN** I’ve known her for so long… (beat) Yet I’ve never seen her quite the way I have lately.

He exhales, struggling for the words.

**LUCIAN** (cont’d) She… challenges me. Makes me look at things differently. Her way of seeing Serim… Earth… (he hesitates, then finally) …the humans.

Lucian falters, at a loss.

**LUCIAN** (cont’d) It’s— (beat, searching) …I can’t explain it.

Rexus studies him quietly. No smirk, no banter — only care. He steps closer, lays a hand on Lucian’s shoulder.

The touch says what he doesn’t: _I hear you. I accept this._

Lucian meets his gaze. The silence between them holds steady — unspoken, but full.

Rexus lets the weight of the silence linger just long enough… then breaks it with his trademark, award winning smile.

Lucian exhales — the faintest grin slipping through his usual composure.

Rexus glances down. Notices the sabre still in Lucian’s hand, idly turning.

**REXUS** (smirk tugging wider) Whatcha gonna do with that, First Light?

Lucian glances at the blade in his hand.

**LUCIAN** Oh, this?

His smile grows as he lifts the sabre, presenting it with a sudden flourish. The motion is effortless, elegant — and for the first time, we glimpse how truly skilled he is. His stance alone betrays a history of precision.

Rexus tilts his head, grin curling.

**REXUS** Careful there, Lucian. Wouldn’t want you to hurt yours—

In a flash, Rexus snatches up a nearby matching sabre, moving quicker than expected.

He strikes. Sharp, playful, but fast.

Lucian parries without effort — as if he knew it was coming before it began. The blades ring, the sound echoing across the workshop.

A spark between them. Playfulness ignited. Gods at play.

**MUSIC CUE: OK Go – _Do What You Want_**

A fast montage of gods playing at mortals’ games:

- **Rexus** vaults a workbench, sabre clashing wildly.
    
- **Lucian** meets him mid-air, blade steady, parry inevitable.
    
- **Rexus** ducks behind a _mannequin in a sequined gown,_ dragging it like a shield.
    
- **Lucian** shakes his head, smiling as he bats the mannequin’s arm aside.
    
- **Rexus** snatches a _prop pistol,_ fires mock shots.
    
- **Lucian** flicks them away with his sabre, unflinching.
    
- **Rexus** dives, crowns scatter, jewels skitter across the floor.
    
- **Lucian** steps into the chaos, precise, elegant — swordplay more dance than duel.
    
- **Rexus** leaps up with a foam spear, jabbing in mock triumph.
    
- **Lucian** snatches it mid-air, twists, and sends Rexus spinning into a pile of masks.
    

They’re laughing — genuine, unguarded. Two brothers, two gods, two boys at play.

The song cuts hard as—

**A STAGEHAND** bursts through the door, carrying a clipboard. He freezes, eyes wide.

**STAGEHAND** What the fuck—?! You guys aren’t supposed to be in here!

Lucian and Rexus both stop mid-motion, caught red-handed like schoolboys.

**CUT TO BLACK.**

### **Scene 8 – Street Banter**

**EXT. NEW YORK STREET – 2AM**

Zadie flicks his lighter, shielding the flame from the wind. Offers it to Aella. She leans in, lips curled around the cigarette, eyes on him. They start walking, cigarettes glowing. Neon buzz, puddles reflecting signs, a siren far off.

**ZADIE**  
This is what I love about this place.

He gestures casually down the block.

**ZADIE** (cont'd)  
You never know what you're gonna see.

A woman ducks into an alley, squats without shame.

**ZADIE** (grinning)  
Like that. Where else do you get that kind of authenticity?

Aella smirks, exhales smoke.

**AELLA**  
Rome. Coliseum. But with more stench and fewer pants.

Zadie chuckles.

**AELLA** (after a drag, more reflective)  
You know… Rome stank of blood. The coliseum wasn't all marble and glory. It reeked. Sweat, piss, rot. And still — it was magnificent.  
(beat)  
We cheered anyway.

**ZADIE** (grinning)  
Of course we did. Bread, circuses. Same as this place.

They pass an eccentric in glitter boots arguing with a parking meter. Zadie gestures.

**ZADIE**  
See? Coliseum hasn't gone anywhere. Just traded lions for late fees.

Aella chuckles, shakes her head.

**AELLA**  
Sometimes I think humanity's greatest creation… is excuses.

**ZADIE**  
And its greatest flaw?  
(beat)  
Not knowing it.

They walk a few steps in silence. Smoke trailing.

**AELLA** (suddenly, a spark of memory)  
You know what I did love? The philosophers. Greeks under olive trees, tearing each other apart with questions.  
(she exhales smoke)  
Where the hell are those fuckers these days?

Up ahead, a drunk twenty-something in a wrinkled polo stumbles out of a bodega — **CHIP**. He blocks half the sidewalk, arms flung wide, sloshing a can of hard seltzer.

**CHIP**  
Do you know who I am? Huh? _Do you even know?_  
(grinning)  
I closed three deals today. Three. Count 'em. Crypto, baby. Changing the world.

Zadie and Aella slow just enough to watch him wobble.

**CHIP**  
My dad says I got more hustle than he ever did. And that man built an empire from scratch. Do you know what it's like to have greatness in your blood?  
(beat, sways)  
Course you don't. Look at you.

**ZADIE** (mock-serious)  
You mean Chip doesn't count?  
(beat, to Aella)  
"Life is pain unless you're Chip." That's some heavy doctrine.

Chip thrusts his hand up for a high five, wobbling.

**CHIP**  
Yo! Big night for me, guys. Huge. Closed deals, made bank. I'm basically unstoppable.

Zadie eyes the hand, smirks.

**ZADIE**  
Mmm… yeah, no. How about elbows, Chip buddy? Let's bring back that timeless COVID greet.

He offers an elbow. Chip squints, then lunges too slow. Their elbows don't connect.

**CHIP**  
Wait, wait—do it again. I got this.

Zadie obliges, half-laughing. Chip still misses, stumbles sideways into the lamppost.

**ZADIE** (mock-serious)  
Seamless execution. Wall Street precision, right there.

Chip cackles, unbothered.

**CHIP**  
That's me, man. Precision. I don't miss. Not ever.

Aella takes a drag, completely unbothered. She looks down at Chip's khakis, soaked from the knee down.

**AELLA**  
Except everything. Including your pants.

Chip glances down at the damp stain, then shrugs like it doesn't matter.

**CHIP**  
Whatever. Winners don't care.

He staggers down the block, still bragging to no one.

Aella exhales smoke, shaking her head.

**AELLA**  
If Chip's the pinnacle of human wisdom, the species is truly doomed.

**ZADIE**  
Eh. Socrates probably slurred too.

She smirks despite herself. They keep walking, the city unfolding in all its absurdity around them.

**AELLA**  
That's humanity's legacy right there.

**ZADIE** (mock-grave, hand over chest)  
Nothing, my crimson goddess.  
(beat, smirks)  
This world being fucked up — that's its charm. Like a ten-car pileup you can't look away from.

Aella exhales, smoke curling.

**AELLA**  
You're twisted.

**ZADIE**  
Takes one to stroll with one.

They walk on, smoke trailing, laughter faint. The city hums around them — neon, oddballs, a drunk bro yelling at a cab.

**ZADIE** (snaps fingers, lit up)  
The speakeasies. Prohibition nights. We were there. Flappers, jazz, bathtub gin…  
(grins)  
I was hard the entire time.

**AELLA** (laughing, groaning)  
Gross, dude. Even then you were impossible.

**ZADIE**  
That joint on 52nd — had to knock twice and say _"Jack sent me."_ Place reeked of gin and cheap perfume.

**AELLA**  
Yeah, and you face-planted into a trumpet player on the way out. Smooth. Real smooth.

**ZADIE**  
The dresses, though. Sequins catching candlelight, feathers brushing your face on the dance floor…

**AELLA**  
And the smoke. Don't romanticize it. You couldn't breathe without coughing up tar.

**ZADIE**  
Ellington live, Armstrong on fire — trumpet blasting in my chest.

**AELLA**  
And you puking in the alley after. Creation at its finest.

**ZADIE**  
Come on, that was humanity creating joy out of nothing. The law said no, and they built entire worlds underground.

**AELLA**  
They built excuses to drink. Same thing, different décor.

**AELLA** (grinning, flicks her cigarette)  
Please. Speakeasies were nothing compared to the Sanskrit Vasantotsava parties. Whole cities painted in color, music in every street.

**ZADIE** (eyes lighting up, nods)  
Oh, yeah… even Lucian and Kaelarys let themselves go for those. You remember?  
(beat, smirks)  
Kaelarys with flower garlands. She pretended she hated it, but she danced.

**AELLA** (laughs)  
She did. And Lucian trying to look solemn with dye smeared across his face.

They both laugh, smoke curling, their steps loose.

**ZADIE**  
You know what still gets me? Woodstock.  
(beat, grinning)  
Three days of rain, mud, music, and every drug in the solar system. You crying during Hendrix's anthem—don't deny it.

**AELLA** (mock offended)  
That was _allergies._

**ZADIE**  
Yeah, sure. Allergies to freedom.

They laugh, walking a few steps in silence. Smoke trailing. The city hums around them.

Zadie flicks ash, then perks up.

**ZADIE**  
You ever hear of Songkran?

**AELLA** (snorts)  
What the fuck is that? A new Chris Brown song?

Zadie bursts out laughing, nearly doubles over.

**ZADIE**  
No, no—listen. It's Thailand. Imagine an entire city at war, right? Streets packed, chaos everywhere—  
(he flashes his hands dramatically)  
But their military is made up entirely of… squirt guns.

**AELLA** (eyes wide, cigarette dangling)  
What? You're serious?

**ZADIE**  
Serious as a heart attack. Buckets, hoses, water balloons—everybody's armed. Three-day flood fight.

**AELLA** (grinning, shaking her head)  
When is this? I'm totally in.

They burst out laughing again, their footsteps light, as though the weight of centuries just fell away.

### **Scene 9 – Plushie Paradise (continued)**

**FADE IN:**

**CLOSE ON** _Evander’s face — smoke curling, eyes soft with thought._

A YOUNG WOMAN (20s, radiant, mischievous) lies across his chest, skin on skin amid a riot of plush toys. Her leg drapes over him lazily.

She studies him for a long moment, tracing idle circles on his ribs.

**WOMAN**  
You talk like a poet who got bored of hearing himself.  
(sly smile)  
You ever stop thinking and just… float?

Evander grins faintly, eyes half-lidded.  
She giggles, then rummages into the mountain of plushies beside her. A small glittery purse emerges.

**WOMAN (cont’d)**  
I have something for that.

She opens the purse, fishes out a tiny strip of LSD tabs, the edges catching neon light from somewhere unseen.

**WOMAN (teasing)**  
When’s the last time you saw God?

Evander chuckles, deep and slow. Her tone is a joke — his answer isn’t.

**EVANDER**  
Well… my dear…  
(beat, eyes far away)  
I suppose it’s been quite a while.

Their eyes meet — hers curious, his remembering.  
She laughs softly, tears off two tabs.

**WOMAN**  
Open up, sexy.

Evander obeys with amused grace.  
She places a tab gently on his tongue — and then another on her own.

She sinks back onto his chest. Silence. The plush world seems to pulse with their breathing.

**WOMAN**  
What does the Divine look like to you?

Evander exhales through a smile, searching his memory — not metaphor, but memory.

**EVANDER**  
Hmm…  
(beat, quiet)  
Very much like me, I suppose.  
(then, softly amused)  
As fathers and sons often do.

She chuckles, thinking it’s a line.

**WOMAN**  
You close with your family?

Evander takes a slow breath, eyes unfocused — a thousand years of something flickering behind them.

**EVANDER**  
Yes.  
(beat)  
I believe so.  
We’ve spent… well… it seems like forever together.

The woman grins, charmed by what she thinks is stoner poetry. She presses a soft kiss to his chest.

**WOMAN**  
Tell me about them.

Evander’s eyes drift upward, the smoke haloing him like memory.

**EVANDER**  
There are nine of us.  
Three brothers, four sisters…  
(beat, faint grin)  
And one who prefers to be both.

The woman’s eyebrows lift — impressed, amused.

**WOMAN**  
That’s… complicated.

**EVANDER**  
Most families are.  
(beat, soft smile)  
Ours just… takes longer to get through dinner.

She laughs, nestling back against him.  

**WOMAN**  
Your mother?

Evander pauses. His fingers still, the smoke curling slowly upward.

**EVANDER**  
Well… I don’t remember having a mother at all.  
(beat)  
I hardly remember my father.

She frowns — exaggerated, sweetly drunk empathy. Her palm rubs slow circles on his chest.

**WOMAN**  
Boo, that’s so sad.  
I’m sure they had their reasons.  
(beat, earnest)  
How are you with that?

Evander smiles faintly, as if the question itself is adorable in its smallness.

**EVANDER**  
I don’t give it much thought.  
I have a good life.  
Things to keep me occupied.

Another WOMAN, also nude, strolls lazily past the plushie pile. Her skin glows in the colored light. She catches Evander’s gaze, smiles with a mischief that lingers a second too long, then drifts off toward a laughing group of revelers in the corner.

Evander watches her go.

**WOMAN (on Evander)**  
That’s such a good attitude.  
Like… when life gives you lemons, right?

Evander chuckles — low, genuine, ancient.

**EVANDER**  
Yes.  
Something like that.

**EVANDER**  
Yes.  
Something like that.

They lie there a moment, her head rising and falling with his breathing. The muffled laughter of others filters through the plush landscape — distant, harmless.

**WOMAN**  
You know, I used to think I’d have it all figured out by now.  
(beat)  
Like there was going to be a day where I’d wake up and just… _know._  
Who I was. What I wanted.  
But every time I think I’m close, it just… shifts again.  
Like the goalpost moves when I’m not looking.

Evander listens quietly, eyes half-closed.

**WOMAN (cont’d)**  
My mom says that’s what growing up is.  
But I don’t think she ever stopped pretending she knew either.

Evander smiles faintly — not unkind, just knowing.

**EVANDER**  
Most people spend their lives convincing themselves the ground is solid.  
They build names, routines, families — anything that feels still.  
(beat)  
But the floor always moves, eventually.

She studies him, curious.

**WOMAN**  
You sound like you’ve been through it.  
Was there ever a time you didn’t know who you were?

He considers. The pause is long, but not uncomfortable.

**EVANDER**  
Once.  
Long ago.  
When I thought being alive meant belonging somewhere.

Her gaze softens; she’s moved but doesn’t quite understand.

**WOMAN**  
And now?

**EVANDER**  
Now I think belonging’s just another way of saying _afraid to leave._

She chuckles softly, half-confused, half-impressed.

**WOMAN**  
You’re kind of impossible, you know that?  
Every answer just raises three more questions.

**EVANDER**  
Then perhaps we’re making progress.

She laughs, presses a lazy kiss to his collarbone, and sighs — a genuine, grounded sound.

**WOMAN**  
Sometimes I wish I could turn my brain off.  
Stop worrying about rent and exes and if I said the wrong thing to someone at brunch.  
Just… _exist._

**EVANDER**  
You already do.  
You just keep remembering you’re supposed to be someone.

She tilts her head up toward him, eyes shining — something between flirtation and awe.

**WOMAN**  
You make that sound easy.

**EVANDER**  
It isn’t.  
But neither is pretending.

A small silence settles — soft, magnetic. The background laughter swells for a moment, then fades again.

She traces a line down his chest, thoughtful.

**WOMAN**  
You really don’t remember your father?

**EVANDER**  
Bits. A voice. A presence. A weight.  
He was… large. Not in size — in meaning.  
Everything else just seemed smaller next to him.

She nods, quietly absorbing it.

Another laugh rings out nearby — **the other woman** drifting closer now, curiosity and mischief in her eyes.

**INT. EVANDER'S LOFT – CONTINUOUS**

The scene shifts to a softer glow. Evander reclines on plush cushions, Jennifer draped across his chest, her fingers tracing lazy patterns on his skin. The ambient music pulses gently.

A WOMAN approaches from the shadows — **MANDY**, mid-twenties, confident stride. She settles onto the cushions opposite Jennifer, completing the triangle.

**MANDY**  
Hi. I'm Mandy.  
(smiles, appraising)  
You two look amazing.

Evander and Jennifer chuckle, exchanging a glance.

**EVANDER**  
Well, Mandy... I'm Evander, and this perfect slice of life you see here is Jennifer.

**MANDY** (sultry)  
Jennifer...

Jennifer looks up from Evander's chest, eyes half-lidded, pupils dilated.

**JENNIFER** (lustily)  
Hi yourself...

The drugs are starting to hit. Time feels slower, warmer.

Mandy leans down, kisses Jennifer lightly. Jennifer leans in, closes her eyes, surrendering to the moment.

A smile spreads slowly across Evander's face.

Jennifer's kiss moves to Evander — slow, deliberate. They kiss deeply. Then she begins her descent, kissing down his chest. Mandy moves up, lips finding Evander's mouth as Jennifer continues lower, passionately kissing down his body until she moves OUT OF FRAME.

Evander leans back in ecstasy, eyes closed.

Mandy smiles against his lips. She begins her own kissing descent — neck, chest, lower — until she too disappears OUT OF FRAME.

We hold on Evander's face. Pleasure washes over him in waves. His breath catches.

He turns his head to the side.

His eyes land on a plushie rhinoceros perched on the cushions beside him, seemingly staring at him through jeweled button eyes.

Evander laughs — a genuine, delighted sound. A beat.

He reaches out, gently covers the rhino's eyes with his hand.

**EVANDER** (chuckling)  
No peeking...

He closes his eyes, head falling back against the cushions as the drugs and pleasure take him over.

FADE TO BLACK.

### **INT. NIGHTCLUB – VIP BOOTH – CONTINUOUS**

The glasses clink. Bass hums beneath, steady as a heartbeat.  
Val and **ADRIAN** hold each other’s gaze — a kingdom and a conqueror, deciding which is which.

**VAL**  
(to the woman, gentle)  
And you — what’s your name?

**WOMAN**  
Cadence.

Val’s smile curves; they tip the glass slightly, eyes never leaving hers.

**VAL**  
Pleased to meet you, Cadence.  
(beat; turns back to the woman, not the man)  
Is he taking good care of you tonight?

A subtle shift — focus on _her_, not _him._  
Adrian catches it instantly.

He straightens, smooth grin sharpening.

**ADRIAN**  
(laughs)  
He has a name.  
Adrian Vey.  
You’ve probably heard it once or twice — cars, clubs, the fights in Monaco.

He says it like a headline, confident, waiting for the flicker of recognition.

**ADRIAN (cont’d)**  
I make it a point to take care of more than one person a night.  
But tonight? She gets the best of me.

Val’s smile stays; their eyes drift toward another companion. A whisper. A soft laugh.  
Adrian’s line lands in the quiet and dies there.

He pushes forward, trying to reclaim the air.

**ADRIAN (cont’d)**  
Anyway — just flew in for the Grammys.  
Private jet, whole thing. You know how it goes—

Val’s head snaps back toward him. The smile thins.

**VAL**  
Adrian.  
You mistake this for an audition.

The booth stills. The bass drops into a low, heavy roll.

Adrian blinks, then forces an easy grin.

**ADRIAN**  
I don’t audition. I arrive.  
Rooms open, people listen.  
That’s not trespass — that’s presence.

Val considers him like a scientist might study fire.

**VAL**  
Presence is not ownership.  
To stride into another kingdom uninvited, to sit upon its throne, whisper to its guards as though they were yours — what do you call that?

**ADRIAN**  
(smirk)  
Confidence.  
You should try it sometime.

**VAL**  
(conspiratorial smile)  
Conquest is an old game, Adrian.  
The tapestry of history is woven from it.  
But even conquerors know the courtesy of sending word ahead.

**ADRIAN**  
Respect’s earned, not handed out.  
You take it, you keep it, that’s the rule.

Val’s tone drops — softer, deadlier.

**VAL**  
Courtesy is survival.

A hush radiates from the booth — sound bending around the words.

**VAL (cont’d)**  
Make no mistake: you didn’t _arrive_, Adrian.  
You were _tolerated._  
A guest indulged only while you amuse.  
(leans in)  
Bore me, presume beyond your station, and this kingdom will remind you how short a fall power really is.

Adrian’s grin twitches, caught between laughter and fear.  
He checks Cadence’s eyes — she’s silent, unsure which way to lean.

He exhales, gathers himself, then stands — smooth again, loud again.

**ADRIAN**  
Hey, relax. All good vibes.  
I’ve got another party waiting anyway. Tyla’s expecting me.

He squeezes Cadence’s hand, flashes one last grin.

**ADRIAN (cont’d)**  
Pleasure, Val. Nice empire you’ve got.

He disappears through the rope, already re-narrating himself to the crowd.

Val watches, motionless.  
Then, a small smile — satisfaction.

A sip. A flicker of strobe.  
**FADE OUT.**

# **SCENE 3 – SERIM GALLERY**

**INT. SERIM GALLERY – TIMELESS**

The hall glows in still light. The Bayeux Tapestry stretches across the marble wall. Lyra drifts through the gallery, buoyant, humming softly. Her fingers toy with a necklace charm as she twirls in her loose layers.

---

**LYRA**  
(grinning, almost to herself)  
Maybe I’ll paint something.

(she spins, skirts flaring)  
Yes—something wild, something loud. I think I could.

(beat, laughing lightly)  
Why not? I mean… it could be fun.

---

**KAELARYS**  
(arms folded, watching distantly)  
Fun can be good.

(beat, her voice softer but even)  
Yes. I think that would be good for you, Lyra.

(she shifts her gaze, detached)  
Something to keep your hands occupied.

---

**LYRA**  
(ignoring the coolness, still glowing)  
Maybe colors they’ve never thought to mix. Reds spilling into blues.

(she presses the necklace to her lips, eyes bright)  
Something that doesn’t look like memory, but like—breath.

(beat — almost childlike in her excitement)  
I’d hang it here, with these. Why not?

---

**KAELARYS**  
(beat — faint smile, not reaching her eyes)  
Why not, indeed.

(she exhales, gaze shifting to the far end of the tapestry)  
Yes, I think… that would suit you.

(her tone drops, distant)  
To make something of your own.

(HOLD — silence. Lyra beams, still caught in her imaginings. Kaelarys does not smile. Her eyes fix on the ragged threads, the unfinished edge swaying faintly.)

**KAELARYS**  
(steady, measured)  
The Normans began this work with such certainty. A grand vision.

(she gestures faintly at the frayed edge)

And yet… they left it hanging.

They didn’t finish. They slipped away.

---

**LYRA**  
(soft, indulgent)  
Unfinished. Yes. Strange that they would leave it so.

---

**KAELARYS**  
Didn’t even stay to see it through.  
Didn’t even wait… to see what it became.

---

**LYRA**  
(confused, watching her closely)  
Kaelarys…?

---

**KAELARYS**  
(voice sharpening, gaining momentum)  
We preserve it.  
We frame it.  
We patch the scraps and call it whole.

(Her breath quickens, tone rising)

As though the absence was holy!

---

**LYRA**  
(steps closer, unsettled)  
You’re not speaking of the tapestry anymore…

---

**KAELARYS**  
(turning, eyes burning)  
He didn’t stay.

(beat — she trembles, then erupts)

He didn’t even wait to see what we became!

---

**LYRA**  
(reaches out, desperate)  
Kaelarys—stop. The Architect gave you purpose—

---

**KAELARYS**  
(cuts her off, voice fierce)  
Purpose? 

(HOLD. Lyra recoils. Kaelarys presses her palm against the tapestry, trembling.)

We are the loose threads.  
An unfinished embroidery.  
Fraying at the edge.

(HOLD — silence stretches. Lyra’s face stricken.)

---

**LYRA**  
(pleading, near tears)  
Kaelarys, please—stop. You’re frightening me.

---

**KAELARYS**  
(turns on her, sharp, accusing)  
Frightening you?

(steps closer, eyes blazing)

You want comfort—words that fit. Neat little lines you can recite.  
That’s not truth, Lyra. That’s a lullaby.

---

**LYRA**  
(stammering, desperate)  
No—He _sees_. The Architect always sees. He gave you your role, your—

---

**KAELARYS**  
(interrupts, raw)  
My leash. My burden. My silence.

(Her voice cracks, brittle with fury.)

What if He never meant to finish us?  
What if we’re nothing more than scraps He abandoned?

---

**LYRA**  
(tearful, begging)  
No—don’t say that. Please don’t.

---

**KAELARYS**  
(erupts, projecting)  
Hurting _you_? Or hurting your illusion?

(Her rage falters; breath shakes. She clutches the tapestry, collapsing into grief.)

…He didn’t stay.

---

(Her knees buckle slightly; she braces against the fabric. Silence floods the gallery.)

---

**LYRA**  
(soft, broken)  
Kaelarys…

---

**KAELARYS**  
(whispers, defeated, eyes closing)  
Unfinished.

---

(HOLD. Stillness. Lyra trembles, terrified not just of Kaelarys’ words, but of the truth in them.)

---

**LYRA**  
Kaelarys… don’t lose yourself. Remember The Pattern.

(beat, urgent)

It’s written into everything. Every path, every choice, every end. It cannot fail us.

---

**KAELARYS**  
(lifts her head slowly — her voice rough, bitter)  
The Pattern.

(she laughs once, hollow)

They say it cannot lie.  
That it charts the future like scripture.

(beat — her hand tightens on the threads)

But look here, Lyra.

The Pattern did not finish this tapestry.  
The Pattern did not stay when He left.

---

**LYRA**  
(pleading, stepping closer)  
It _is_ His hand! The Architect’s gift—guidance, law, truth—

---

**KAELARYS**  
(spins on her, furious)  
Law? Truth?

(shouting now)

It is numbers.  
Probabilities.

(beat — softer, biting)

A mirror of our fear.

(Her eyes blaze, stepping closer)

We follow it like scripture.  
Bow to it like it loves us.

But The Pattern does not love us.  
It does not see us.

---

**LYRA**  
(tearful, almost begging)  
Without it, we’re lost! We would scatter, fall apart—

---

**KAELARYS**  
(cuts her down, voice fierce, almost breaking)  
Without it… we are free.

(HOLD — silence. The words echo in the marble hall. Lyra recoils as though struck.)

---

**KAELARYS**  
(softer now, trembling, almost to herself)  
The Pattern does not create.  
It only predicts.

(beat — eyes wet, hollow)

And what is a prophecy worth…  
if the one who wrote it is already gone?

(HOLD — her shoulders sag. The fight drains into dread. She sways, then her knees give. Kaelarys drops, crumpling to the marble floor.)

---

**LYRA**  
(gasping, rushing forward)  
Kaelarys!

(she falls to her knees, catching her sister in her arms, holding her close)

---

**KAELARYS**  
(breath ragged, voice breaking )  
He’s never coming back.

(beat — she grips Lyra’s hand, eyes wet)

**KAELARYS**  
Abandoned in His half-made world,  
clinging to silence as if it were love.

(beat — her voice drops, trembling)

We live as gods…  
but we’re nothing more than orphans.

(HOLD. The words hang in the silence. Lyra clutches her tighter, trembling, unable to answer. The gallery looms vast, the unfinished tapestry watching over them.)

---

**CUT TO: MONTAGE.**

**MONTAGE - HALF-SPEED/MUSIC VIDEO STYLE** _"Famous Last Words" - My Chemical Romance_

**MUSEUM GALLERY** CLOSE on KAELARYS' face—tears, breaking: "We act like gods, but we're nothing more than orphans."

Beat.

Music EXPLODES.

**CUT TO:**

**MUSEUM PROP ROOM - BURST OF MOVEMENT** Doors SLAM open. Lucian and Rexus barrel out, prop swords gleaming under fluorescent lights. Staff member frozen, mouth agape.

**HALLWAY - RUNNING** Lucian's feet POUNDING marble. Rexus behind him, gaining. Their breath visible in the cold air-conditioned space.

**LUCIAN SPINS** - half-speed, coat flaring.

Rexus' sword ARCS down.

CLANG. Lucian parries. The impact reverberates. These aren't just props in their hands—every movement is precise, trained, deadly serious beneath the absurdity.

**CUT TO:**

**NYC STREETS - GOLDEN HOUR** Aella and Zadie drifting down the sidewalk. Cigarette smoke curls between them. They bump shoulders—giggling.

SCREECH. Electric scooter VEERS. They SCATTER—

Zadie catches Aella's arm. They BURST into laughter, bodies pressed against a storefront, hearts racing.

**CUT TO:**

**APARTMENT - PLUSHIE PILE** Evander's POV—ceiling spinning slowly. Colors breathing. A woman's face drifts into frame, smiling, distant.

REVERSE - Evander sits up through a sea of stuffed animals. Bodies everywhere. A couple entwined on the couch. Someone dancing alone by the window, backlit. Two people deep in conversation, gesturing wildly about nothing.

Evander's hand reaches out—SLOW MOTION—fingers closing around a joint on the coffee table. He brings it to his lips. Lighter FLARES. Orange glow. Inhale. Hold. Exhale—smoke fills frame.

**CUT TO:**

**CLUB - VIP SECTION** PUSH IN on Val's face. That smirk. Adrian's silhouette disappearing into the crowd below. Val leans back, scotch in hand.

Below him: CHAOS. Bodies moving. Lights strobing. Bass THUMPING through everything.

Val raises his glass slightly. Victory.

**CUT TO:**

**MUSEUM GALLERY - WIDE OVERHEAD SHOT** Kaelarys crumpled in Lyra's arms. The Bayeux Tapestry stretches across the entire background—medieval figures frozen in their ancient war.

Just music.

Hold. Hold. Hold.

Lyra's hand strokes Kaelarys' hair.

**CUT TO:**

**MUSEUM LOBBY - ESCALATING** CLANG. CLANG. Lucian and Rexus burst into the main space.

Patrons TURN—

An elderly woman clutches her pearls.

A teenager pulls out his phone, filming.

A security guard speaks urgently into his radio.

Two college students CHEER.

The fight continues—parry, thrust, dodge. They're moving toward the MAIN ENTRANCE. Glass doors visible ahead.

More staff converging. Running. Shouting.

**CUT TO:**

**NYC STREETS - RECKLESS** CLOSE on Zadie's hand. Coke on his skin. He brings it to his nose—SNIFF. Doesn't even look around. People passing. Cabs honking. He dabs another bump.

Extends his hand to Aella.

She leans in—SNIFF. Straightens up, head tilting back.

They walk—swaying, serpentine.

Aella SPINS—arms out, face to the sky, streetlights becoming stars.

Zadie watches her, laughing—pure, unguarded.

**CUT TO:**

**APARTMENT HALLWAY - BEHIND EVANDER** Wide shot. Evander NUDE, walking down the narrow corridor. His arms outstretched like he's underwater. Joint between his lips, smoke trailing behind him like a veil.

He SWAYS. His hips move to the music. Completely unselfconscious. Completely gone.

His fingers drag along the wall.

Reaches the bathroom door.

Hand on knob.

Turns.

Steps in.

Door closes.

HOLD on the closed door.

**CUT TO:**

**CLUB - CLOSE ON VAL**

Tight on his face. The smirk. The satisfaction.

Then—

Something flickers.

The smile doesn't quite reach his eyes anymore.

He blinks slowly.

Around him—REVELERS. Dancing. Screaming. Laughing. Kissing.

But Val is REMOVED. We PUSH CLOSER as the world around him blurs.

His face relaxes.

The satisfaction drains away.

What's left is emptiness.

He stares into his glass.

Music still PUMPING but we can barely hear it now.

Val sinks into his seat.

Deeper.

His eyes go distant.

Deeper.

The lights play across his face but don't touch him.

Deeper.

Until he's just a body in a chair, surrounded by life he can't feel anymore.

**HOLD.**

**FADE TO BLACK.**

Bridge of montage, volume drops-

**INT. SERIM GALLERY – TIMELESS**

Kaelarys rests in Lyra’s arms, her head against her sister’s chest. Her eyes are open, calm but wet, fixed on the tapestry’s unfinished edge. Lyra gently strokes her hair, steady and tender.

---

**KAELARYS**  
(soft, almost amused through the exhaustion)  
…Stupid tapestry.

---

(beat — Lyra glances at her, then back to the embroidery. A small, warm smile.)

**LYRA**  
(comforting, playful)  
Stupid tapestry, indeed.

---

Kaelarys exhales — a quiet, broken chuckle. Lyra smiles wider, leaning down to rest her head against Kaelarys’.

The two sisters stay there, huddled together on the floor beneath the looming threads.

**CUT TO: ECU – THE TAPESTRY'S EDGE.**

The embroidery stops abruptly. Mid-battle. Loose threads dangle, unfinished. Fraying.

---

**CUT TO CREDITS — montage music rises, carrying us out.**
