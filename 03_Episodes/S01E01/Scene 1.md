INT. SERIM GALLERY – TIMELESS

**ECU – BAYEUX TAPESTRY.**  Threads shimmer.  Total silence.
(Hold)

**ECU – KAELARYS’ EYES.**.
(Hold)

**CUT TO – TAPESTRY SEGMENTS:**

– **HALLEY’S COMET**
   *SFX: low wind rising — a breath that builds into a distant whoosh, like atmosphere breaking.*
   The stitched star blazes above.  Mortals point skyward, terrified.
   (Hold, The wind fades.)

– **EDWARD’S FUNERAL**
   *SFX: muffled sobbing, cloth rustle, one church bell toll.*
   The draped body lies still.  Mourners bend, faces lost in thread.
   (Hold, The bell’s ring dies out in reverb.)

– **BURNING HOMES**
   *SFX: crackling fire, timbers snapping, distant screams of women and children.*
   Soldiers drive them out; smoke threads through the embroidery.
   (Hold,. Screams taper to embers hissing.)

**PULL BACK – WIDE**
The sounds collapse into silence as the full tapestry fills the frame.
Marble.  Light.  Perfect stillness.

Only Kaelarys stands before it. Arms crossed. Regal. A portrait of control.  

(SILENCE. We let it breathe. We experience Kaelarys' silent contemplation. 10 seconds too long..)  

Then—**A HUMMED SONG.**  
Low. Cheerful.  
(HOLD — the note curls through the stillness, fragile but persistent.)  

Kaelarys blinks. Her eyes shift, as if awakened from deep thought.  

She turns, slightly.  

**ACROSS THE GALLERY: LYRA.**  
A silhouette first, drifting. Wide shot — let her arrive slowly.  
Earth-toned layers. Bare feet. Tattoos like constellations.  
She hums as she moves, hand hovering above the tapestry, close but untouching.  

(HOLD — CU on her hand suspended over thread.)  

She stops before a panel of carnage.  

**LYRA** (soft, barely above breath)  
They were grieving.  

(HOLD. Silence after. Kaelarys absorbs it without movement.)  

**KAELARYS** (controlled, almost brittle)  
Grieving?  

Lyra lifts her eyes. Warm. The opposite of Kaelarys’ precision.  

**LYRA**  
Every stitch is mourning.  

(HOLD. Kaelarys’ eyes shift.)  

**KAELARYS**  
Enlighten me. What do you see?  

(SLIGHT ACCELERATION — Lyra steps closer, but still soft.)  

**LYRA**  
Look here.  
(her hand drifts above uneven threads)  
The pulls tighten in the battles. The embroiderers’ hands were trembling. Not clumsy. Remembering.  
They stitched their own wounds into history.  

**CUTAWAY – ECU THREADS. Pulled taut. Imperfect. Echoed across panels.**  
SFX: Moans, swords clashing.  Battle sounds.
(Let the fabric itself speak.)  

Back to Kaelarys.

**KAELARYS**  
Flaws, I thought.  

**LYRA** (softer still)  
Saxon women, forced to embroider their defeat. To make beauty of their own undoing.  

Kaelarys shifts, moves her arms behind her back. She looks at the tapestry, and then to Lyra.  Kaelarys watches Lyra inspect the tapestry, as if studying her.
(HOLD — silence between them, stretched.)  

**KAELARYS** (measured)  
You were made for this — attuned to currents others overlook. The Architect gave you that resonance.  

Lyra, patient.  (HOLD)

She turns to Kaelarys.

**LYRA**  
And you, Kaelarys? What was your frequency meant to be?  

**ECU**: Kaelarys - looking inward. Eyes scanning. 

**KAELARYS** (quiet)  
I protect what must not be lost. I ensure... what is created endures.  
Even when the creator is gone.

Kaelarys holds her gaze on Lyra.
(She is not just speaking of artifacts.)  

Lyra studies her in silence.)  

A slow, knowing smile curves across Lyra’s face.  
She steps closer, a sudden move, clashing with the softness.  

**LYRA** (playful, with a mischievous glint)  
You look beautiful.  

Kaelarys blinks, the compliment, and energy breaking the tension.  

**KAELARYS** (low, warning)  
Lyra…  

**LYRA** (insistent, whisper-light)  
Truly regal. Untouchable.  Like marble.
(beat, teasing)  
Very pretty marble.  

Kaelarys exhales — and this time, it breaks.  
Her lips twitch, then curve into a reluctant smirk.  

**KAELARYS** (dry, amused despite herself)  
Really? Marble?  

Lyra beams, triumphant. She steps in closer, slipping her arms around Kaelarys in a sudden, unguarded sisterly side hug.  

Kaelarys stiffens for a fraction of a beat — then releases, allowing herself to be held.  
The smirk lingers, softening into something rarer: a true smile.  

(HOLD — the two of them, pressed together in quiet, both gazing at the tapestry. Stone and song, finally touching.)  

Lyra tilts her head against Kaelarys’ shoulder, still smiling.

Kaelarys raises her arms, pressing her hands against Lyra's arms.

Lyra grins, emboldened. 

**LYRA**
Dance with me. Kaelarys.

She steps back, takes Kaelarys' hands, trying to coax her into a slow spin.  
Kaelarys resists, stiff, indulgent at best.

**KAELARYS** (deadpan)  
Lyra…

**LYRA** (playful)  
Just for a moment. Move with me.

Lyra twirls, fabrics sweeping, humming softly. She pulls on Kaelarys’ arms — Kaelarys remains inert, letting herself be moved through the dance. Lyra leans back, arms spreading, eyes closing. Letting the gallery hold her. Trusting the space.

She leans too far.

Kaelarys catches her immediately—firm hand between her shoulder blades, the other steadying her arm.  

Lyra opens her eyes, laughs—delighted.

**LYRA** (soft, joyful)  
Protector. Preserver. Even of me.

Kaelarys’ expression shifts; she cannot deny it.

**KAELARYS**  
(quiet, certain)  
That’s what He wanted of me—

A beat.  The conviction holds.  
Her gaze drifts — not away, just inward.  
Something subtle passes through her expression; the thought arrives, uninvited.

**KAELARYS**  
(softer, to herself)  
...I think.

She exhales.  The tension in her hands eases.  
She steadies Lyra upright and lets go, a fraction too slow.

Lyra stays close, smiling — then  eases back, drifting as though unbothered.  

She turns, almost twirling, then half-laughs to herself.  

**LYRA** (teasing, light, like a passing thought.)  
I'm not even sure what He wants from us anymore.  
(beat, playful)  
I mean, He never really gave us instructions.
What if I'm meant to be YOUR protector, pretty marble statue.

Her soft laugh spills into a hum, dissolving into melody as she drifts away.  

(HOLD. Kaelarys watches.  
Her face tightens.)

Lyra's hum fades into the distance, swallowed by the gallery's vastness.

Kaelarys turns back to the tapestry—but her eyes drift.

She glances toward Lyra dancing, humming.

(HOLD. Kaelarys' expression—concern, unsure.)

Her gaze lingers. Then slowly, she looks back to the tapestry.

**CUT TO: ECU – PANEL 26.**
**A divine hand reaching from the sky.**

(HOLD.)

She glances toward Lyra across the gallery. Distant now. Still humming.

**FADE TO BLACK.**
