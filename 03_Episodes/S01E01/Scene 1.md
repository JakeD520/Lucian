**FADE IN:**

**ECU – BAYEUX TAPESTRY.** Threads shimmer. Ancient silence.  
(HOLD. Silence continues. Longer. Too long.)  

**ECU – KAELARYS’ EYES.** Hazel-green. Focus sharp, scanning. Pupils contract, searching.  
(HOLD — her gaze lingers unnaturally long, silence almost suffocating.)  

**CUT TO – TAPESTRY SEGMENTS.**  
– **Halley’s Comet.** A stitched star blazing above, mortals pointing, awestruck and terrified.  
(HOLD.)  
– **Edward’s Funeral.** The body draped, mourners bent in lament. A hollow seat of power.  
(HOLD.)  
– **Burning Homes.** Women clutching children, soldiers driving them out, fire consuming roof beams.  
(HOLD.)  

**PULL BACK – INT. SERIM GALLERY.**  
The tapestry hangs immaculate, unprotected by glass, as though time itself obeys this place.  
Marble. Light. Perfect stillness.  

Kaelarys stands before it. Arms crossed. Regal, severe. A portrait of control.  

(SILENCE. We let it breathe. 10 seconds too long.)  

Then—**A HUM.**  
Low. Almost accidental.  
(HOLD — the note curls through the stillness, fragile but persistent.)  

Kaelarys blinks. Not emotion, not irritation. Just awareness.  
A disruption.  

She turns, slightly.  

**ACROSS THE GALLERY: LYRA.**  
A silhouette first, drifting. Wide shot — let her arrive slowly.  
Earth-toned layers. Bare feet. Tattoos like constellations.  
She hums as she moves, hand hovering above the tapestry, close but untouching.  

(HOLD — CU on her hand suspended over thread.)  

She stops before a panel of carnage.  

**LYRA** (soft, barely above breath)  
They were grieving.  

(HOLD. Silence after. Kaelarys absorbs it without movement.)  

**KAELARYS** (controlled, almost brittle)  
Grieving?  

Lyra lifts her eyes. Warm. The opposite of Kaelarys’ precision.  

**LYRA**  
Every stitch is mourning.  

(HOLD. Kaelarys’ eyes shift. A hairline crack.)  

**KAELARYS**  
Enlighten me. What do you see in their mourning?  

(SLIGHT ACCELERATION — Lyra steps closer, but still soft.)  

**LYRA**  
Look here.  
(her hand drifts above uneven threads)  
The pulls tighten in the battles. The embroiderers’ hands were trembling. Not clumsy. Remembering.  
They stitched their own wounds into history.  

**CUTAWAY – ECU THREADS. Pulled taut. Imperfect. Echoed across panels.**  
(HOLD — let the fabric itself speak.)  

**KAELARYS**  
Flaws, I thought.  

**LYRA** (softer still)  
Saxon women, forced to embroider their defeat. To make beauty of their own undoing. Each stitch an act of survival.  

Kaelarys exhales, subtle. Moves her arms behind her back.  
(HOLD — silence between them, stretched.)  

**KAELARYS** (measured, not unkind)  
You were made for this — attuned to currents others overlook. The Architect gave you that resonance.  

Lyra meets her gaze. Patient. Waiting.  

**LYRA**  
And you, Kaelarys? What was your frequency meant to be?  

(SILENCE. It sharpens. Kaelarys does not answer.)  

Kaelarys looks back to the tapestry. Eyes scanning.  
(HOLD — almost too long, her profile against burning rooftops.)  

**KAELARYS** (quiet, more to herself — but glances toward Lyra, a flicker)  
I preserve what must not be lost. I ensure… what is created survives beyond the creator.  

(HOLD. Subtext clear. She is not just speaking of artifacts.)  

Lyra’s gaze lingers on her. Then, gently, she turns back to the tapestry.  

Silence returns. Heavy, but alive.  

(HOLD. Kaelarys’ last words hang in the air.  
Lyra studies her in silence, reading the unspoken.)  

A slow, knowing smile curves across Lyra’s face.  
She steps closer — soft, unhurried, barefoot against stone.  

**LYRA** (gently, but with a mischievous glint)  
You look beautiful.  

Kaelarys blinks, the compliment breaking the tension by inches.  

**KAELARYS** (low, warning)  
Lyra…  

**LYRA** (insistent, whisper-light)  
Truly. Regal. Untouchable.  Like marble.
(beat, teasing)  
Pretty marble.  

Kaelarys exhales — and this time, it breaks.  
Her lips twitch, then curve into a reluctant smirk.  

**KAELARYS** (dry, amused despite herself)  
Really? Marble?  

Lyra beams, triumphant. She steps in closer, slipping her arms around Kaelarys in a sudden, unguarded hug.  

Kaelarys stiffens for a fraction of a beat — then releases, allowing herself to be held.  
The smirk lingers, softening into something rarer: a true smile.  

(HOLD — the two of them, pressed together in quiet, the tapestry looming behind. Stone and song, finally touching.)  

Lyra tilts her head against Kaelarys’ shoulder, still smiling.

LLyra grins, emboldened. She steps back, takes Kaelarys' hands, trying to coax her into a slow spin.  
Kaelarys resists, stiff, indulgent at best.

**KAELARYS** (deadpan)  
Lyra…

**LYRA** (playful)  
Just once. Move with me.

Lyra twirls, fabrics sweeping, humming softly—then she leans back, arms spreading, eyes closing.  
Letting the gallery hold her. Trusting the space.

She leans too far.

Kaelarys catches her immediately—firm hand between her shoulder blades, the other steadying her arm.  
(HOLD. They stay suspended there, Lyra tilted back, Kaelarys grounding her.)

Lyra opens her eyes, laughs—delighted, not sheepish.

**LYRA** (still grinning)  
See?

Kaelarys exhales, the faintest smile breaking through her exasperation.

**LYRA** (soft, certain)  
Protector. Preserver. Even of me.

(HOLD. The truth vibrates in the silence.  
Kaelarys’ expression shifts; she cannot deny it.)  

Her arms loosen, but she does not let go.  

**KAELARYS** (quiet, almost to herself)  
It’s what I was made for... I think.  

(HOLD. Her words settle heavy in the air. A breath too long.)  

Lyra stays close, smiling — then slowly eases back, drifting as though untethered.  
(HOLD. Fabrics trailing, her bare feet whisper against marble.)  

She turns, almost twirling, then half-laughs to herself.  

**L**LYRA** (teasing, light, almost absentminded)  
I'm not even sure what He wants from us anymore.  
(beat, playful)  
Maybe I'm meant to be YOUR protector, pretty marble statue.

Her soft laugh spills into a hum, dissolving into melody as she drifts away.  
The sound is fragile, like it could vanish at any second.

(HOLD. Kaelarys watches. Her smirk falters.  
Her face tightens.)

Lyra's hum fades into the distance, swallowed by the gallery's vastness.

Kaelarys turns back to the tapestry—but her eyes drift.

She glances toward Lyra across the gallery. Distant now. Still humming. Unaware.

(HOLD. Kaelarys' expression—something between protection and helplessness.)

Her gaze lingers. Then slowly, she looks back to the tapestry.

**CUT TO: ECU – THE TAPESTRY'S EDGE.**

The embroidery stops abruptly. Mid-battle.  
Loose threads dangle, unfinished. Fraying.

(HOLD.)

**FADE TO BLACK.**
