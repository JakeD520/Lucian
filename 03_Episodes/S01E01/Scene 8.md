### **Scene 8 – Street Banter**

**EXT. NEW YORK STREET – 2AM**

Zadie flicks his lighter, shielding the flame from the wind. Offers it to Aella. She leans in, lips curled around the cigarette, eyes on him. They start walking, cigarettes glowing. Neon buzz, puddles reflecting signs, a siren far off.

**ZADIE**  
This is what I love about this place.

He gestures casually down the block.

**ZADIE** (cont'd)  
You never know what you're gonna see.

A woman ducks into an alley, squats without shame.

**ZADIE** (grinning)  
Like that. Where else do you get that kind of authenticity?

Aella smirks, exhales smoke.

**AELLA**  
Rome. Coliseum. But with more stench and fewer pants.

Zadie chuckles.

**AELLA** (after a drag, more reflective)  
You know… Rome stank of blood. The coliseum wasn't all marble and glory. It reeked. Sweat, piss, rot. And still — it was magnificent.  
(beat)  
We cheered anyway.

**ZADIE** (grinning)  
Of course we did. Bread, circuses. Same as this place.

They pass an eccentric in glitter boots arguing with a parking meter. Zadie gestures.

**ZADIE**  
See? Coliseum hasn't gone anywhere. Just traded lions for late fees.

Aella chuckles, shakes her head.

**AELLA**  
Sometimes I think humanity's greatest creation… is excuses.

**ZADIE**  
And its greatest flaw?  
(beat)  
Not knowing it.

They walk a few steps in silence. Smoke trailing.

**AELLA** (suddenly, a spark of memory)  
You know what I did love? The philosophers. Greeks under olive trees, tearing each other apart with questions.  
(she exhales smoke)  
Where the hell are those fuckers these days?

Up ahead, a drunk twenty-something in a wrinkled polo stumbles out of a bodega — **CHIP**. He blocks half the sidewalk, arms flung wide, sloshing a can of hard seltzer.

**CHIP**  
Do you know who I am? Huh? _Do you even know?_  
(grinning)  
I closed three deals today. Three. Count 'em. Crypto, baby. Changing the world.

Zadie and Aella slow just enough to watch him wobble.

**CHIP**  
My dad says I got more hustle than he ever did. And that man built an empire from scratch. Do you know what it's like to have greatness in your blood?  
(beat, sways)  
Course you don't. Look at you.

**ZADIE** (mock-serious)  
You mean Chip doesn't count?  
(beat, to Aella)  
"Life is pain unless you're Chip." That's some heavy doctrine.

Chip thrusts his hand up for a high five, wobbling.

**CHIP**  
Yo! Big night for me, guys. Huge. Closed deals, made bank. I'm basically unstoppable.

Zadie eyes the hand, smirks.

**ZADIE**  
Mmm… yeah, no. How about elbows, Chip buddy? Let's bring back that timeless COVID greet.

He offers an elbow. Chip squints, then lunges too slow. Their elbows don't connect.

**CHIP**  
Wait, wait—do it again. I got this.

Zadie obliges, half-laughing. Chip still misses, stumbles sideways into the lamppost.

**ZADIE** (mock-serious)  
Seamless execution. Wall Street precision, right there.

Chip cackles, unbothered.

**CHIP**  
That's me, man. Precision. I don't miss. Not ever.

Aella takes a drag, completely unbothered. She looks down at Chip's khakis, soaked from the knee down.

**AELLA**  
Except everything. Including your pants.

Chip glances down at the damp stain, then shrugs like it doesn't matter.

**CHIP**  
Whatever. Winners don't care.

He staggers down the block, still bragging to no one.

Aella exhales smoke, shaking her head.

**AELLA**  
If Chip's the pinnacle of human wisdom, the species is truly doomed.

**ZADIE**  
Eh. Socrates probably slurred too.

She smirks despite herself. They keep walking, the city unfolding in all its absurdity around them.

**AELLA**  
That's humanity's legacy right there.

**ZADIE** (mock-grave, hand over chest)  
Nothing, my crimson goddess.  
(beat, smirks)  
This world being fucked up — that's its charm. Like a ten-car pileup you can't look away from.

Aella exhales, smoke curling.

**AELLA**  
You're twisted.

**ZADIE**  
Takes one to stroll with one.

They walk on, smoke trailing, laughter faint. The city hums around them — neon, oddballs, a drunk bro yelling at a cab.

**ZADIE** (snaps fingers, lit up)  
The speakeasies. Prohibition nights. We were there. Flappers, jazz, bathtub gin…  
(grins)  
I was hard the entire time.

**AELLA** (laughing, groaning)  
Gross, dude. Even then you were impossible.

**ZADIE**  
That joint on 52nd — had to knock twice and say _"Jack sent me."_ Place reeked of gin and cheap perfume.

**AELLA**  
Yeah, and you face-planted into a trumpet player on the way out. Smooth. Real smooth.

**ZADIE**  
The dresses, though. Sequins catching candlelight, feathers brushing your face on the dance floor…

**AELLA**  
And the smoke. Don't romanticize it. You couldn't breathe without coughing up tar.

**ZADIE**  
Ellington live, Armstrong on fire — trumpet blasting in my chest.

**AELLA**  
And you puking in the alley after. Creation at its finest.

**ZADIE**  
Come on, that was humanity creating joy out of nothing. The law said no, and they built entire worlds underground.

**AELLA**  
They built excuses to drink. Same thing, different décor.

**AELLA** (grinning, flicks her cigarette)  
Please. Speakeasies were nothing compared to the Sanskrit Vasantotsava parties. Whole cities painted in color, music in every street.

**ZADIE** (eyes lighting up, nods)  
Oh, yeah… even Lucian and Kaelarys let themselves go for those. You remember?  
(beat, smirks)  
Kaelarys with flower garlands. She pretended she hated it, but she danced.

**AELLA** (laughs)  
She did. And Lucian trying to look solemn with dye smeared across his face.

They both laugh, smoke curling, their steps loose.

**ZADIE**  
You know what still gets me? Woodstock.  
(beat, grinning)  
Three days of rain, mud, music, and every drug in the solar system. You crying during Hendrix's anthem—don't deny it.

**AELLA** (mock offended)  
That was _allergies._

**ZADIE**  
Yeah, sure. Allergies to freedom.

They laugh, walking a few steps in silence. Smoke trailing. The city hums around them.

Zadie flicks ash, then perks up.

**ZADIE**  
You ever hear of Songkran?

**AELLA** (snorts)  
What the fuck is that? A new Chris Brown song?

Zadie bursts out laughing, nearly doubles over.

**ZADIE**  
No, no—listen. It's Thailand. Imagine an entire city at war, right? Streets packed, chaos everywhere—  
(he flashes his hands dramatically)  
But their military is made up entirely of… squirt guns.

**AELLA** (eyes wide, cigarette dangling)  
What? You're serious?

**ZADIE**  
Serious as a heart attack. Buckets, hoses, water balloons—everybody's armed. Three-day flood fight.

**AELLA** (grinning, shaking her head)  
When is this? I'm totally in.

They burst out laughing again, their footsteps light, as though the weight of centuries just fell away.
