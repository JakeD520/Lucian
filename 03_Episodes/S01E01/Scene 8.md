Aella Zadie 

### **Scene 8 – Dialogue Sketch**

**EXT. NEW YORK STREET – 2AM**  
Zadie flicks his lighter, shielding the flame from the wind. Offers it to Aella. She leans in, lips curled around the cigarette, eyes on him.

**AELLA**  
What’s the one thing you’d change on this planet?

**ZADIE** (mock-grave, hand over chest)  
Nothing, my crimson goddess.  
(beat, smirks)  
This world being fucked up — that’s its charm. Like a ten-car pileup you can’t look away from.

Aella exhales, smoke curling. She smirks.

**AELLA**  
You’re twisted.

**ZADIE**  
Takes one to stroll with one.

They walk, the city shifting around them — neon, oddballs, a drunk bro yelling at a cab.

**AELLA** (after a drag, more reflective)  
You know… Rome stank of blood. The coliseum wasn’t all marble and glory. It reeked. Sweat, piss, rot. And still — it was magnificent.  
(beat)  
We cheered anyway.

**ZADIE** (grinning)  
Of course we did. Bread, circuses. Same as this place.

They pass an eccentric in glitter boots arguing with a parking meter. Zadie gestures.

**ZADIE**  
See? Coliseum hasn’t gone anywhere. Just traded lions for late fees.

Aella chuckles, shakes her head.

**AELLA**  
Sometimes I think humanity’s greatest creation… is excuses.

**ZADIE**  
And its greatest flaw? … Not knowing it.

They walk on, smoke trailing, laughter faint, as the strange city theater continues around them.

### **Scene 8 – Refined Beat**

**EXT. NEW YORK STREET – 2AM**  
Cigarettes glow as they stroll. Neon buzz, puddles reflecting signs.

**AELLA**  
You know what this place needs?  
(beat, looking around)  
Remember sitting under olive trees, listening to Greek philosophers?  
People tearing the world apart with questions… not just noise.  
(she exhales smoke)  
We don’t have that anymore.

Zadie smirks, flicks ash.

**ZADIE**  
What, you didn’t care for the solid wisdom Chip was spewing back there?  
(beat, mock serious)  
Guy had some deep existential shit buried under the slurring.

Aella smirks despite herself, shaking her head.

**AELLA**  
If Chip’s the philosopher, we’re doomed.

**ZADIE**  
Eh. Socrates probably slurred too.

She exhales, smoke curling. The city hums around them. They walk on, unconcerned.

### **Scene 8 – Street Banter (Zadie & Aella)**

**EXT. NEW YORK STREET – 2AM**  
They walk side by side, cigarettes glowing. The city hums — neon, puddles, a siren far off.

**ZADIE**  
This is what I love about this place.  
He gestures casually down the block.  
You never know what you’re gonna see.

A woman ducks into an alley, squats without shame.

**ZADIE** (grinning)  
Like that. Where else do you get that kind of authenticity?

Aella smirks, exhales smoke.

**AELLA**  
Rome. Coliseum. But with more stench and fewer pants.

Zadie chuckles.

**AELLA** (suddenly, a spark of memory)  
You know what I did love?  
The philosophers. Greeks under olive trees, tearing each other apart with questions.  
Where the hell are those fuckers these days?

**ZADIE**  
You mean Chip doesn’t count?  
(beat, solemn mock)  
“Life is pain unless you’re Chip.” That’s some heavy doctrine.

Aella smirks despite herself, eyes glinting.

**AELLA**  
If Chip’s the pinnacle of human wisdom, the species is truly doomed.

They keep walking, smoke trailing, the city unfolding in all its absurdity around them.

- **ZADIE** (snaps fingers, lit up)  
    The speakeasies. Prohibition nights. We were there. Flappers, jazz, bathtub gin…  
    (grins)  
    I was hard the entire time.
    

**AELLA** (laughing, groaning)  
Gross, dude. Even then you were impossible.

---

- **ZADIE**  
    That joint on 52nd — had to knock twice and say _“Jack sent me.”_ Place reeked of gin and cheap perfume.
    

**AELLA**  
Yeah, and you face-planted into a trumpet player on the way out. Smooth. Real smooth.

---

- **ZADIE**  
    The dresses, though. Sequins catching candlelight, feathers brushing your face on the dance floor…
    

**AELLA**  
And the smoke. Don’t romanticize it. You couldn’t breathe without coughing up tar.

---

- **ZADIE**  
    Ellington live, Armstrong on fire — trumpet blasting in my chest.
    

**AELLA**  
And you puking in the alley after. Creation at its finest.

---

- **ZADIE**  
    Come on, that was humanity creating joy out of nothing. The law said no, and they built entire worlds underground.
    

**AELLA**  
They built excuses to drink. Same thing, different décor.

**AELLA** (grinning, flicks her cigarette)  
Please. Speakeasies were nothing compared to the Sanskrit Vasantotsava parties. Whole cities painted in color, music in every street.

**ZADIE** (eyes lighting up, nods)  
Oh, yeah… even Lucian and Kaelarys let themselves go for those. You remember?  
(beat, smirks)  
Kaelarys with flower garlands. She pretended she hated it, but she danced.

**AELLA** (laughs)  
She did. And Lucian trying to look solemn with dye smeared across his face.

They both laugh, smoke curling, their steps loose.

**ZADIE**  
You know what still gets me? Woodstock.  
(beat, grinning)  
Three days of rain, mud, music, and every drug in the solar system. You crying during Hendrix’s anthem—don’t deny it.

**AELLA** (mock offended)  
That was _allergies._

**ZADIE**  
Yeah, sure. Allergies to freedom.

They laugh, walking a few steps in silence. Smoke trailing. The city hums around them.

Zadie flicks ash, then perks up.

**ZADIE**  
You ever hear of Songkran?

**AELLA** (snorts)  
What the fuck is that? A new Chris Brown song?

Zadie bursts out laughing, nearly doubles over.

**ZADIE**  
No, no—listen. It’s Thailand. Imagine an entire city at war, right? Streets packed, chaos everywhere—  
(he flashes his hands dramatically)  
But their military is made up entirely of… squirt guns.

**AELLA** (eyes wide, cigarette dangling)  
What? You’re serious?

**ZADIE**  
Serious as a heart attack. Buckets, hoses, water balloons—everybody’s armed. Three-day flood fight.

**AELLA** (grinning, shaking her head)  
When is this? I’m totally in.

They burst out laughing again, their footsteps light, as though the weight of centuries just fell away.

**EXT. NEW YORK STREET – 2AM**  
Aella and Zadie stroll, smoke curling. Up ahead, a drunk twenty-something in a wrinkled polo stumbles out of a bodega — **CHIP**. He blocks half the sidewalk, arms flung wide.

**CHIP**  
Do you know who I am? Huh? _Do you even know?_  
(grinning, sloshing a can of hard seltzer)  
I closed three deals today. Three. Count ‘em. Crypto, baby. Changing the world.

Zadie and Aella slow just enough to watch him wobble.

**CHIP**  
My dad says I got more hustle than he ever did. And that man built an empire from scratch. Do you know what it’s like to have greatness in your blood?  
(beat, sways)  
Course you don’t. Look at you.

Aella takes a drag, completely unbothered.

**AELLA**  
He smells like piss.

Zadie looks down at Chip’s khakis, soaked from the knee down.

**ZADIE** (deadpan)  
Hmm. Well. Hopefully you can buy some piss-free pants with your trust fund there, Chippy.

Chip stares, processing, then just laughs too loud.

**CHIP**  
You’re jealous. Everyone’s jealous. That’s how I know I’m winning.

He staggers down the block, still bragging to no one.

Aella exhales smoke, shaking her head.

**AELLA**  
That’s humanity’s legacy right there.

**EXT. NEW YORK STREET – 2AM**  
Chip stumbles into their path, grinning wide, seltzer can dripping down his wrist.

**CHIP**  
Yo! Big night for me, guys. Huge. Closed deals, made bank. I’m basically unstoppable.

He thrusts his hand up for a high five, wobbling.

Zadie eyes the hand, smirks.

**ZADIE**  
Mmm… yeah, no. How about elbows, Chip buddy? Let’s bring back that timeless COVID greet.

He offers an elbow. Chip squints, then lunges too slow. Their elbows don’t connect.

**CHIP**  
Wait, wait—do it again. I got this.

Zadie obliges, half-laughing. Chip still misses, stumbles sideways into the lamppost.

**ZADIE** (mock-serious)  
Seamless execution. Wall Street precision, right there.

Chip cackles, unbothered.

**CHIP**  
That’s me, man. Precision. I don’t miss. Not ever.

Aella exhales smoke, unimpressed.

**AELLA**  
Except everything. Including your pants.

Chip glances down at the damp stain on his khakis, then shrugs like it doesn’t matter.

**CHIP**  
Whatever. Winners don’t care.

He totters off, still bragging to the night.

Zadie watches him go, amused.
