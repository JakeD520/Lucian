**INT. ROYAL OPERA HOUSE – GRAND CORRIDOR – NIGHT**

Marble underfoot. Velvet-lined walls. The echo of the aria still rolling. Lucian and Rexus walk side by side—figures cut from the same fabric as the building itself: poised, untouchable.

They pass gilded doors, portraits of patrons, ushers at perfect stillness. Every detail curated, immaculate.

Then—up ahead—a STAFF DOOR. Plain. Functional. A woman in blacks appears, moving briskly. She swipes a badge, slips inside without breaking stride. The door swings back on its hinge—about to shut.

Rexus glances at Lucian, then casually plants his foot against the frame, stopping it cold.

Lucian raises a brow.

**LUCIAN** Really.

**REXUS** (half-grin) If we only walk the halls they give us, we’ll never see what’s worth stealing.

He eases the door open. The golden light of the corridor spills into shadowed concrete.

Lucian hesitates just a breath, then follows him through.

**INT. BACK-OF-HOUSE – SERVICE CORRIDOR – NIGHT**

The shift is instant. Velvet and marble give way to raw plaster, exposed pipes, the hum of machinery. The air smells faintly of dust and rosin. Fluorescents buzz overhead, casting everything in stark, unflattering light.

They move past stacked flight cases, wheeled risers, signage taped to the wall in Sharpie: **“ACT II – STAGE LEFT”**, **“COSTUMES TO GREEN ROOM.”**

Rexus runs a hand across a battered trunk as they pass, grinning like a boy on a dare.

Lucian takes it all in—calm, absorbing.

They reach another door, half ajar. Rexus pulls it open wider—The two enter.

**INT. PROP WORKSHOP – NIGHT**

Fluorescents buzz awake. Long benches stretch across the space, cluttered with tools, brushes, and half-finished props. Racks brim with swords, rifles, mannequins in half-stitched gowns. The faint echo of the aria bleeds through the walls.

Rexus steps in first, eyes bright.

He strolls along one of the benches, running his hand over unfinished crowns, a drying pistol, the frame of a chandelier waiting for glass. He picks things up, sets them down again, like a kid in someone else’s toy box.

**REXUS** (natural, without looking back) Nice to see you out of Serim for once.

Lucian stands a few paces back, still at the threshold. Watching.

Lucian steps further in, gaze drifting across the benches — half-painted props, sabers on a rack, a mask drying in resin.

**LUCIAN** Yeah. I’ve been doing a lot of… thinking.

Lucian picks up a prop saber, turns it idly in his hand.

Rexus looks up from the workbench. His mouth starts to open — a question hanging there — then he stops himself. Closes it. He studies Lucian instead, fingers tapping lightly against a discarded crown.

A long beat.

Finally, Rexus exhales, voice softer than usual.

**REXUS** (shrugging, as if finishing a story mid-thought)  
Yeah. I wanted to stay with her.

(beat, he waves a hand vaguely)

Didn’t matter. She died anyway.

He moves on, flipping a sabre off a rack, twirling it without looking.

**REXUS** (cont’d, casual, almost mocking himself)  
Thirty thousand sunsets. She treated each one like the last. I thought maybe I could… I don’t know. Be mortal enough to get it.

(he smirks, dry)

Turns out infinity flattens everything.

Lucian watches from the threshold. He doesn’t interrupt — just lets Rexus talk, lets him drain it out.

(Hold)

Rexus lets the weight of the silence linger just long enough… then breaks it with his trademark, award winning smile.

Lucian exhales — the faintest grin slipping through his usual composure.

Rexus glances down. Notices the saber still in Lucian’s hand, idly turning.

**REXUS** (smirk tugging wider) Whatcha gonna do with that, First Light?

Lucian glances at the blade in his hand.

**LUCIAN** Oh, this?

His smile grows as he lifts the sabre, presenting it with a sudden flourish. The motion is effortless, elegant — and for the first time, we glimpse how truly skilled he is. His stance alone betrays a history of precision.

Rexus tilts his head, grin curling.

**REXUS** Careful there, Lucian. Wouldn’t want you to hurt yours—

In a flash, Rexus snatches up a nearby matching sabre, moving quicker than expected.

He strikes. Sharp, playful, but fast.

Lucian parries without effort — as if he knew it was coming before it began. The blades ring, the sound echoing across the workshop.

A spark between them. Playfulness ignited. Gods at play.

**MUSIC CUE: OK Go – _Do What You Want_**

A fast montage of gods playing at mortals’ games:

- **Rexus** vaults a workbench, sabre clashing wildly.
    
- **Lucian** meets him mid-air, blade steady, parry inevitable.
    
- **Rexus** ducks behind a _mannequin in a sequined gown,_ dragging it like a shield.
    
- **Lucian** shakes his head, smiling as he bats the mannequin’s arm aside.
    
- **Rexus** snatches a _prop pistol,_ fires mock shots.
    
- **Lucian** flicks them away with his sabre, unflinching.
    
- **Rexus** dives, crowns scatter, jewels skitter across the floor.
    
- **Lucian** steps into the chaos, precise, elegant — swordplay more dance than duel.
    
- **Rexus** leaps up with a foam spear, jabbing in mock triumph.
    
- **Lucian** snatches it mid-air, twists, and sends Rexus spinning into a pile of masks.
    

They’re laughing — genuine, unguarded. Two brothers, two gods, two boys at play.

The song cuts hard as—

**A STAGEHAND** bursts through the door, carrying a clipboard. He freezes, eyes wide.

**STAGEHAND** What the fuck—?! You guys aren’t supposed to be in here!

Lucian and Rexus both stop mid-motion, caught red-handed like schoolboys.

**CUT TO BLACK.**
