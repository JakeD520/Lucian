**INT. SKYBOX – ROYAL OPERA HOUSE – NIGHT** (CONTINUATION)

_The aria below reaches a crescendo. Lucian's attention drifts from the stage, the signet ring resuming its slow turn on his finger. Something has shifted—a restlessness, a sense of purpose pulling him elsewhere._

**REXUS** (noticing, low) You're done with this, aren't you?

**LUCIAN** (glancing toward the stage) The performance is exquisite, but—

**REXUS** We have plenty of time for exquisite, my friend.

_Lucian meets his gaze. That silent understanding passes between them—immortals with no concerns of lack._

**LUCIAN** Intermission's not for another twenty minutes.

**REXUS** (grinning) Then we leave them wanting more.

_He rises with fluid grace, turning fully toward Charlotte. Her political advisor immediately tenses, sensing the shift in energy._

**REXUS** (charming, direct to Charlotte) We're stepping out for some air. The soprano's voice is divine, but frankly, you're far more captivating than anything on that stage.

_Charlotte's eyes widen—equal parts scandalized and thrilled. This is exactly the kind of reckless attention her position forbids._

**CHARLOTTE** (breathless, trying for propriety) That's... highly inappropriate.

**REXUS** (with a slight bow) The most interesting conversations usually are.

_Her advisor clears her throat sharply—a warning that goes completely ignored._

**REXUS** (to Charlotte, voice lower) Don't let them bore you to death while we're gone.

_As they move toward the door, Charlotte's soft laugh follows them—reckless and exhilarated._

**INT. ROYAL OPERA HOUSE – GRAND CORRIDOR – NIGHT**

Marble underfoot. Velvet-lined walls. The echo of the aria still rolling. Lucian and Rexus walk side by side—figures cut from the same fabric as the building itself: poised, untouchable.

They pass gilded doors, portraits of patrons, ushers at perfect stillness. Every detail curated, immaculate.

Then—up ahead—a STAFF DOOR. Plain. Functional. A woman in blacks appears, moving briskly. She swipes a badge, slips inside without breaking stride. The door swings back on its hinge—about to shut.

Rexus glances at Lucian, then casually plants his foot against the frame, stopping it cold.

Lucian raises a brow.

**LUCIAN** Really.

**REXUS** (half-grin) If we only walk the halls they give us, we’ll never see what’s worth stealing.

He eases the door open. The golden light of the corridor spills into shadowed concrete.

Lucian hesitates just a breath, then follows him through.

**INT. BACK-OF-HOUSE – SERVICE CORRIDOR – NIGHT**

The shift is instant. Velvet and marble give way to raw plaster, exposed pipes, the hum of machinery. The air smells faintly of dust and rosin. Fluorescents buzz overhead, casting everything in stark, unflattering light.

They move past stacked flight cases, wheeled risers, signage taped to the wall in Sharpie: **“ACT II – STAGE LEFT”**, **“COSTUMES TO GREEN ROOM.”**

Rexus runs a hand across a battered trunk as they pass, grinning like a boy on a dare.

Lucian takes it all in—calm, absorbing.

They reach another door, half ajar. Rexus pulls it open wider—The two enter.

**INT. PROP WORKSHOP – NIGHT**

Fluorescents buzz awake. Long benches stretch across the space, cluttered with tools, brushes, and half-finished props. Racks brim with swords, rifles, mannequins in half-stitched gowns. The faint echo of the aria bleeds through the walls.

Rexus steps in first, eyes bright.

He strolls along one of the benches, running his hand over unfinished crowns, a drying pistol, the frame of a chandelier waiting for glass. He picks things up, sets them down again, like a kid in someone else’s toybox.

**REXUS** (natural, without looking back) Nice to see you out of Serim for once.

Lucian stands a few paces back, still at the threshold. Watching.

Lucian steps further in, gaze drifting across the benches — half-painted props, sabres on a rack, a mask drying in resin.

**LUCIAN** Yeah. I’ve been doing a lot of… thinking.

Lucian picks up a prop sabre, turns it idly in his hand.

Rexus looks up from the workbench. His mouth starts to open — a question hanging there — then he stops himself. Closes it. He studies Lucian instead, fingers tapping lightly against a discarded crown.

A long beat.

Finally, Rexus exhales, voice softer than usual.

**REXUS** I’ve noticed you and Lyra have been spending a lot of time together.

Lucian pauses. The silence stretches — a little longer than comfortable. His grip tightens slightly on the sabre in his hand.

When he speaks, it’s slower, more deliberate than usual.

**LUCIAN** I’ve known her for so long… (beat) Yet I’ve never seen her quite the way I have lately.

He exhales, struggling for the words.

**LUCIAN** (cont’d) She… challenges me. Makes me look at things differently. Her way of seeing Serim… Earth… (he hesitates, then finally) …the humans.

Lucian falters, at a loss.

**LUCIAN** (cont’d) It’s— (beat, searching) …I can’t explain it.

Rexus studies him quietly. No smirk, no banter — only care. He steps closer, lays a hand on Lucian’s shoulder.

The touch says what he doesn’t: _I hear you. I accept this._

Lucian meets his gaze. The silence between them holds steady — unspoken, but full.

Rexus lets the weight of the silence linger just long enough… then breaks it with his trademark, award winning smile.

Lucian exhales — the faintest grin slipping through his usual composure.

Rexus glances down. Notices the sabre still in Lucian’s hand, idly turning.

**REXUS** (smirk tugging wider) Whatcha gonna do with that, First Light?

Lucian glances at the blade in his hand.

**LUCIAN** Oh, this?

His smile grows as he lifts the sabre, presenting it with a sudden flourish. The motion is effortless, elegant — and for the first time, we glimpse how truly skilled he is. His stance alone betrays a history of precision.

Rexus tilts his head, grin curling.

**REXUS** Careful there, Lucian. Wouldn’t want you to hurt yours—

In a flash, Rexus snatches up a nearby matching sabre, moving quicker than expected.

He strikes. Sharp, playful, but fast.

Lucian parries without effort — as if he knew it was coming before it began. The blades ring, the sound echoing across the workshop.

A spark between them. Playfulness ignited. Gods at play.

**MUSIC CUE: OK Go – _Do What You Want_**

A fast montage of gods playing at mortals’ games:

- **Rexus** vaults a workbench, sabre clashing wildly.
    
- **Lucian** meets him mid-air, blade steady, parry inevitable.
    
- **Rexus** ducks behind a _mannequin in a sequined gown,_ dragging it like a shield.
    
- **Lucian** shakes his head, smiling as he bats the mannequin’s arm aside.
    
- **Rexus** snatches a _prop pistol,_ fires mock shots.
    
- **Lucian** flicks them away with his sabre, unflinching.
    
- **Rexus** dives, crowns scatter, jewels skitter across the floor.
    
- **Lucian** steps into the chaos, precise, elegant — swordplay more dance than duel.
    
- **Rexus** leaps up with a foam spear, jabbing in mock triumph.
    
- **Lucian** snatches it mid-air, twists, and sends Rexus spinning into a pile of masks.
    

They’re laughing — genuine, unguarded. Two brothers, two gods, two boys at play.

The song cuts hard as—

**A STAGEHAND** bursts through the door, carrying a clipboard. He freezes, eyes wide.

**STAGEHAND** What the fuck—?! You guys aren’t supposed to be in here!

Lucian and Rexus both stop mid-motion, caught red-handed like schoolboys.

**CUT TO BLACK.**
