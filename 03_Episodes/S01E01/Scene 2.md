EXT. PALAIS GARNIER – NIGHT

Paris. A palace of light.  
Statues glint gold against the facade, columns bathed in amber glow.  
Carriages and black cars line the boulevard.  

Patrons ascend the marble steps — gowns sweeping, tuxedos gleaming.  
A night to be seen.  

INT. PALAIS GARNIER – GRAND STAIRCASE – CONTINUOUS

White marble. Red carpet.  
The staircase curves upward in two sweeping arcs,  
built not just to climb — but to display.  

Couples pause mid-ascent, turning like portraits.  
Chandeliers blaze. Jewelry flashes.  
The hush of wealth fills the air.  

INT. MAIN AUDITORIUM – CONTINUOUS

Red velvet. Gold leaf.  
A chandelier the size of a carriage hangs overhead,  
glowing beneath Chagall’s painted sky.  

Five tiers of balconies curve around the stage —  
a golden horseshoe, every box a frame.  

The lights dim. Silence falls.

**ON STAGE:**

The curtain rises. _La Traviata_, Act III.

VIOLETTA lies in bed, pale, dying. The set is opulent but muted—wealth unable to stop death.

The soprano begins—**"Addio del passato"** (Farewell to the past).

Her voice: fragile, beautiful, breaking.

**HOLD on the performance. Let it breathe. The audience is transfixed.**

_"Addio del passato bei sogni ridenti..."_  
(Farewell, happy dreams of the past...)

The strings swell beneath her. Grief made sound.

**PULL BACK—through the rapt faces, up through the tiers...**

**TO: SKYBOX – TOP TIER**

LUCIAN and REXUS.

Handsome. Tailored suits—but Rexus' tie is loosened, top button undone. Lucian's posture is too relaxed, one arm draped over the back of his chair.

They look like they wandered into a wedding reception and decided to stay.

Champagne glasses. Rexus has his feet propped on the railing (scandalous).

They're watching the stage—but casually. Like you'd watch a rerun of a show you love.

The soprano's voice fills the space.

_"Le mie grazie... cadute... avvizzite..."_  
(My charms... fallen... withered...)

Rexus tilts his head slightly. Appreciative.

**REXUS** (quiet, to Lucian)  
She's good.

**LUCIAN** (not looking away from the stage)  
Better than last season.

They settle back. Comfortable. The opera continues.

**In the neighboring box:**

CHARLOTTE, mid-20s, beautiful, polished. Expensive but understated dress. She's trying to look engaged with the opera but is clearly... a little bored.

Next to her: MARSHALL, 40s, sharp suit, sharper eyes. He's not watching the opera—he's watching _her_. And scanning the room.

Rexus notices Charlotte. Grins.

**REXUS** (to Lucian, low)  
That's the Transport Minister's daughter.

**LUCIAN** (barely glancing over)  
You're not her type.

**REXUS**  
I'm everyone's type.

He catches her eye. Holds it.

Charlotte smiles—quick, then looks away. But she looks back.

Marshall notices immediately. His jaw tightens.

(The opera continues. The soprano's voice tender, building.)

Rexus raises his champagne glass toward Charlotte—subtle, just for her.

She bites back a smile. Glances at Marshall, then back.

**REXUS** (to Lucian, still watching her)  
She has Taresh's smile.

**LUCIAN** (glances at him, recognizing the name)  
Taresh?

**REXUS** (grin softening, nostalgic)  
Yeah. That same... I don't know. Mischief hiding behind manners.

Charlotte tilts her head slightly—curious about him.

Rexus mouths something. She can't quite make it out, squints, smiles anyway.

**REXUS** (to Lucian, still playing)  
Taresh used to do that too. This look like she was deciding whether I was worth the trouble.

**LUCIAN**  
And?

**REXUS**  
She decided I was.

(beat)

For a while, anyway.

Marshall leans toward Charlotte, whispers something. Warning.

Charlotte nods—polite, dismissive—doesn't look away from Rexus.

**REXUS** (watching, amused)  
Her people had these... advisors too. Elders, they called them. Always hovering. Always worried she'd make the wrong choice.

**LUCIAN**  
Did she?

**REXUS** (grin widening)  
Absolutely.

Charlotte laughs at something—maybe she caught what Rexus mouthed, maybe she's just enjoying the game.

**REXUS** (quieter, remembering)  
Taresh had this laugh. Gods, you could hear it across the whole plaza. Her father hated it—said it wasn't dignified for someone of her position.

(beat)

She didn't care.

Marshall's hand moves to Charlotte's arm now. Gentle but firm.

**REXUS** (to Lucian, watching Marshall)  
They tried to keep us apart. Thought I was... what did they call it? "Unsuitable for her station."

**LUCIAN**  
They weren't wrong.

**REXUS**  
No. But that's what made it fun.

Marshall stands now—done with subtlety. He leans down, whispers urgently to Charlotte.

Charlotte resists for a moment—one more glance at Rexus.

**REXUS** (to Lucian, quieter)  
You know, I saw this coming. The advisor, the exit. Whole thing.

**LUCIAN**  
And you did it anyway.

**REXUS**  
That's the difference between us. You see the Pattern and _accept_ it. I see it and think... what if I push here? What if I—

**LUCIAN**  
You see threads. I see the whole tapestry.

**REXUS** (grin, self-aware)  
Yeah. I can never follow it like you can, Lucian. Sure, I see it. But not like you do.

Charlotte rises. Marshall's hand on her elbow, guiding.

**REXUS** (watching her stand)  
With Taresh... I thought I could see enough. Her city, her people—I knew what was coming. Thought I had fifty years to figure it out.

Charlotte looks back one last time. Apologetic smile.

Rexus raises his glass. Playful wave.

She waves back—coy, a little regretful.

Then she's gone.

**REXUS** (still watching the empty doorway)  
Turns out fifty years isn't long at all.

(pause, the grin fading)

Not when you've lived eighteen million.

The opera swells. The soprano's voice fragile, breaking.

Rexus settles back in his seat. The playfulness drains.

**REXUS** (quieter now, different)  
I wanted to stay with her.

Lucian looks at him. This is new.

Rexus takes a sip of champagne.

Turns his attention to the stage.

**ON STAGE:**

Violetta lies in bed, pale, dying. Alfredo kneels beside her, taking her hand.

The music shifts—quieter now, intimate.

**VIOLETTA** (singing, fragile)  
_"È strano... è strano..."_  
(It's strange... it's strange...)

She's looking at him with something like wonder. Like she can't believe he's there. That he stayed.

**VIOLETTA** (continuing)  
_"...in ciel, in terra..."_  
(in heaven, on earth...)

Her hand reaches for his face. Touches it gently—like she's trying to memorize it.

Because she knows. She's running out of time.

**BACK TO THE SKYBOX:**

Rexus watches. Still. Silent.

His fingers tighten slightly around his champagne glass.

**ON STAGE:**

Alfredo pulls her close. Desperate. Like if he holds her tight enough, he can keep her here.

But she's already fading.

The strings swell—mournful, inevitable.

Violetta’s voice trembles through her final phrases.  
Applause swells—polite, reverent, the kind of sound that tries to smooth over death.

**IN THE SKYBOX**

Rexus doesn’t clap. He just watches the curtain fall.

Lucian studies him—knows better than to speak.

The house lights rise halfway. Murmured conversation, the rustle of programs.  
Patrons stretch, sip champagne, laugh too loudly.  
The spell breaks.

Rexus leans back, eyes on nothing.

> **REXUS**  
> They cheer a woman dying… then toast to her courage.  
> _(beat)_  
> Mortals make grief look festive.

Lucian doesn’t reply. The orchestra tunes softly below—strings sighing, cellos humming like a low tide.

A VOICE comes over the house speakers, smooth and ceremonial.

> **ANNOUNCER (V.O.)**  
> Ladies and gentlemen—our next selection,  
> from _Manon Lescaut_:  
> “**Sola, perduta, abbandonata**,”  
> performed by Giulia Ferrani.

Polite applause. Then the lights fade again—slower this time.

Rexus doesn’t move.

---

### **ON STAGE**

The curtain rises on emptiness.  
A cracked wasteland glows under amber haze.  
A single figure stands at its center—alone.

Wind machines whisper through the orchestra pit.

The soprano begins, soft but unflinching:

> **SOPRANO (O.S.)**  
> _“Sola, perduta, abbandonata in landa desolata…”_  
> _(Alone, lost, abandoned in this desolate land.)_

Her voice climbs the walls, thin as breath, enormous as memory.

---

### **IN THE SKYBOX**

Rexus exhales—barely audible.

Lucian turns; something in his brother’s face has changed.  
Stillness. Recognition.

> **REXUS**  
> (quiet, almost to himself)  
> That word…  
> _Abbandonata._

The strings deepen, the desert light bleeding across his reflection in the glass.

**HOLD** on the two of them as the aria builds—  
mortal despair echoing through divine silence.


**BACK TO REXUS:**

His jaw tightens. He doesn't look away from the stage.

(Long beat. The music fills the silence.)

**REXUS** (still watching the stage)  
Not just... be with her.

(pause)

I mean really stay.

(pause)

She used to cry at sunsets.

(He finally looks away from the stage, at his hands.)

Not sad. Just... overwhelmed. Said she only had thirty thousand left. Maybe.

(beat)

Thirty thousand sunsets and she treated each one like it was the last.

**LUCIAN**  
You've told me about her before.

**REXUS**  
Not this part.

(He takes a drink. Sets the glass down.)

I wanted what she had. That... weight. Where things _matter_ because they're slipping away.

(pause, looking back at the stage)

I'm sitting here right now, not even watching. I've seen this opera forty times. Fifty. The soprano hits the same notes and I feel... nothing.

(quieter)

That's what infinity does. It flattens everything.

(He stops. Shakes his head.)

I thought—what if I just become like her? What if I stop being... this?

**LUCIAN**  
You wanted to be mortal.

**REXUS**  
I _needed_ to understand what she felt. Waking up knowing you have limits. That your body will fail. That you'll forget things.

(pause)

It terrified me.

(beat)

But it felt real. More real than anything I'd felt in—

(He stops. Looks at Lucian.)

I don't even know if the Architect would allow that. Can we change what we are? Did He make us... fixed?

(pause)

I never asked. Never thought to ask.

**LUCIAN** (careful)  
I don't know.

**REXUS**  
No. Neither do I.

(He looks back at the stage. The music swells.)

I saw it coming. The fault line. Fifty years out, I could see the stress building.

(beat)

You would've seen it earlier. A hundred years, probably. Seen the whole cascade.

(pause)

But even if I'd seen it sooner... could I have stopped it? Or was she always going to die no matter what I did?

(His voice tightens.)

The Pattern doesn't care how much you love someone.

**LUCIAN**  
Rexus...

**REXUS** (not stopping)  
Charlotte reminded me of her. Not just the smile. The recklessness. Choosing the wrong guy because it's more interesting.

(beat)

Eighteen million years and I'm still playing the same game. Still drawn to the same type.

(pause)

Taresh died and I learned nothing.

(Silence. The opera continues below. Rexus stares at nothing.)

Lucian doesn't say anything.

He just reaches over. Places his hand on Rexus' shoulder. Steady. Grounding.

Rexus looks up. Meets his eyes.

A look passes between them—_I'm good. Thank you._

(Beat.)

Rexus picks up his glass. Drains it.

Smiles.

**REXUS**  
Let's get the fuck out of here, dude.

Lucian smiles back. Takes a final sip of his champagne.

**LUCIAN**  
Let's do it.

He sets his half-full glass down.

Rexus grabs it. Chugs that too.

Lucian laughs.

They stand. Head for the exit.

The opera continues below—oblivious.
