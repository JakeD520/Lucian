## The Opening Structure:

**FADE IN:**

**EXT. ROYAL OPERA HOUSE – NIGHT**

London. Grand architecture. Carriages, limousines. Patrons in gowns and tuxedos ascending the steps.

Wealth. Status. Ceremony.

**INT. ROYAL OPERA HOUSE – LOBBY – CONTINUOUS**

Marble. Chandeliers. Champagne flutes on silver trays.

Hushed, reverent conversation. Programs rustling.

**INT. MAIN AUDITORIUM – CONTINUOUS**

Five tiers of balconies. Gold leaf everywhere. A sea of faces upturned toward the stage.

The lights dim. Silence falls.

**ON STAGE:**

The curtain rises. _La Traviata_, Act III.

VIOLETTA lies in bed, pale, dying. The set is opulent but muted—wealth unable to stop death.

The soprano begins—**"Addio del passato"** (Farewell to the past).

Her voice: fragile, beautiful, breaking.

**HOLD on the performance. Let it breathe. The audience is transfixed.**

_"Addio del passato bei sogni ridenti..."_  
(Farewell, happy dreams of the past...)

The strings swell beneath her. Grief made sound.

**PULL BACK—through the rapt faces, up through the tiers...**

**TO: SKYBOX – TOP TIER**

LUCIAN and REXUS.

Handsome. Tailored suits—but Rexus' tie is loosened, top button undone. Lucian's posture is too relaxed, one arm draped over the back of his chair.

They look like they wandered into a wedding reception and decided to stay.

Champagne glasses. Rexus has his feet propped on the railing (scandalous).

They're watching the stage—but casually. Like you'd watch a rerun of a show you love.

The soprano's voice fills the space.

_"Le mie grazie... cadute... avvizzite..."_  
(My charms... fallen... withered...)

Rexus tilts his head slightly. Appreciative.

**REXUS** (quiet, to Lucian)  
She's good.

**LUCIAN** (not looking away from the stage)  
Better than last season.

They settle back. Comfortable. The opera continues.
