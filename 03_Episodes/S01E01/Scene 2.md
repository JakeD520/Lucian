EXT. PALAIS GARNIER – NIGHT

Paris. A palace of light.  
Statues glint gold against the facade, columns bathed in amber glow.  
Carriages and black cars line the boulevard.  

Patrons ascend the marble steps — gowns sweeping, tuxedos gleaming.  
A night to be seen.  

INT. PALAIS GARNIER – GRAND STAIRCASE – CONTINUOUS

White marble. Red carpet.  
The staircase curves upward in two sweeping arcs,  
built not just to climb — but to display.  

Couples pause mid-ascent, turning like portraits.  
Chandeliers blaze. Jewelry flashes.  
The hush of wealth fills the air.  

INT. MAIN AUDITORIUM – CONTINUOUS

Red velvet. Gold leaf.  
A chandelier the size of a carriage hangs overhead,  
glowing beneath Chagall’s painted sky.  

Five tiers of balconies curve around the stage —  
a golden horseshoe, every box a frame.  

The lights dim. Silence falls.

**ON STAGE:**

The curtain rises. _La Traviata_, Act III.

VIOLETTA lies in bed, pale, dying. The set is opulent but muted—wealth unable to stop death.

The soprano begins—**"Addio del passato"** (Farewell to the past).

Her voice: fragile, beautiful, breaking.

**HOLD on the performance. Let it breathe. The audience is transfixed.**

_"Addio del passato bei sogni ridenti..."_  
(Farewell, happy dreams of the past...)

The strings swell beneath her. Grief made sound.

**PULL BACK—through the rapt faces, up through the tiers...**

**TO: SKYBOX – TOP TIER**

LUCIAN and REXUS.

Handsome. Tailored suits—but Rexus' tie is loosened, top button undone. Lucian's posture is too relaxed, one arm draped over the back of his chair.

They look like they wandered into a wedding reception and decided to stay.

Champagne glasses. Rexus has his feet propped on the railing (scandalous).

They're watching the stage—but casually. Like you'd watch a rerun of a show you love.

The soprano's voice fills the space.

Rexus tilts his head slightly. Appreciative.

**REXUS** (quiet, to Lucian)  
She's pretty good.

**LUCIAN** (not looking away from the stage)  
Better than last season.

They settle back. Comfortable. The opera continues.

**In the neighboring box:**

**In the neighboring box:**  

CHARLOTTE, mid-20s, beautiful, polished. The kind of beauty trained to withstand scrutiny.  
Her dress is expensive but understated — nothing that could spark gossip.

She smiles when Marshall glances her way — perfect, practiced, diplomatic.  
But the moment his eyes move back to the stage, it falters.  
A softer, truer smile slips out. Curious. Almost mischievous.

That’s when she meets Rexus’ gaze.

Rexus grins.

**REXUS** (to Lucian, low)  
That's the Trade Minister's daughter.

**LUCIAN** (barely glancing over)  
You're not her type.

**REXUS**  
I'm everyone's type.

He catches her eye. Holds it.

Charlotte smiles—quick, then looks away. But she looks back.

Marshall notices immediately. His jaw tightens.

(The opera continues. The soprano's voice tender, building.)

Rexus raises his champagne glass toward Charlotte—subtle, just for her.

She bites back a smile. Glances at Marshall, then back.

**REXUS** (to Lucian, still watching her)  
She has Taresh's smile.

**LUCIAN** (glances at him, recognizing the name)  
Taresh...from Crete?

**REXUS** (grin softening, nostalgic)  
Yeah. That same... I don't know. Mischief hiding behind manners.

Charlotte tilts her head slightly—curious about him.

Rexus mouths something. She can't quite make it out, squints, smiles anyway.

**REXUS** (to Lucian, still playing)  
Taresh used to do that too. This look like she was deciding whether I was worth the trouble.

**LUCIAN**  
And?

**REXUS**  
She decided I was.

(beat)

For a while, anyway.

Marshall leans toward Charlotte, whispers something. Warning.

Charlotte nods—polite, dismissive—doesn't look away from Rexus.

**REXUS** (watching, amused)  
Her people had these... advisors too.  Always hovering. Always worried she'd make the wrong choice.

**LUCIAN**  
Did she?

**REXUS** (grin widening)  
Abso-fucking-lutely.

A little too loud.

Charlotte catches his overzealous profanity, laughs.

**CUT TO – MAIN STAGE**

Violetta clutches the letter, her voice breaking:  
_"Presto gioia e dolore, addio per sempre…"_  
(Soon joy and sorrow alike will be over.)
The aria lingers, unflinching.

**BACK TO THE SKYBOX:**

**REXUS** (quieter, remembering)  
Taresh had this laugh. You could hear it across the whole plaza. Her father hated it—said it wasn't dignified for someone of her position.

(beat)

She didn't care.

Marshall's hand moves to Charlotte's arm now. Gentle but firm.

**REXUS** (to Lucian, his eyes on Marshall and Charlotte)  
They tried to keep us apart. Thought I was... what did they call it? "Unsuitable for her station."

**LUCIAN**  (laughs at the irony.  an immortal being "unsuitable")
If they only knew.

**REXUS**  
But that's what made it fun.

Marshall stands now—done with subtlety. He leans down, whispers urgently to Charlotte.

Charlotte resists for a moment—one more glance at Rexus.

**REXUS** (to Lucian, quieter)  
You know, I saw this coming. The advisor, the exit. Whole thing.

**LUCIAN**  
And you did it anyway.

**REXUS**  
That's the difference between us, Lucian. You see the Pattern and _accept_ it. I see it and think... what if I push here? What if I—

**LUCIAN**  
You see threads. I see the whole tapestry.

**REXUS** (grin, self-aware)  
Yeah. I can never follow it like you can, Lucian. Sure, I see it. But not like you do.

Charlotte rises. Marshall's hand on her elbow, guiding.

**REXUS** (watching her stand)  
With Taresh... I thought I could see enough. Her city, her people—I knew what was coming. I had fifty years to figure it out

Charlotte looks back one last time. Apologetic smile.

Rexus raises his glass. Playful wave.

She waves back—coy, a little regretful.

Then she's gone.

**REXUS** (still watching the empty doorway)  
Turns out fifty years isn't long at all.

(pause, the grin fading)

Not when you've lived millions.

Rexus settles back in his seat. The playfulness drains.

**REXUS** (indifferent)  
I wanted to stay with her.

Lucian looks at him. This is new.

Rexus takes a sip of champagne.

Turns his attention to the stage.

**CUT TO – MAIN STAGE**

Violetta clutches the letter, her voice breaking:  
_"Addio… del passato bei sogni ridenti…"_  
(Everything is at an end.)

Her body folds against the bed,  
silks collapsing like the life draining from her.  

The strings swell—mournful, inevitable.

Violetta’s voice trembles through her final phrases.  
Applause swells—polite, reverent, the kind of sound that tries to smooth over death.

**IN THE SKYBOX**

Rexus doesn’t clap. He just watches the curtain fall.

Lucian studies him—he doesn't speak.

The house lights rise halfway. Murmured conversation, the rustle of programs.  
Patrons stretch, sip champagne, laugh too loudly.  
The spell breaks.

A VOICE comes over the house speakers, smooth and ceremonial.

 **ANNOUNCER (V.O.)**  
 Ladies and gentlemen—our next selection,  
 from _Manon Lescaut_:  
 “**Sola, perduta, abbandonata**,”  

Polite applause. Then the lights fade again—slower this time.
### **ON STAGE**

The curtain rises on emptiness.  
A cracked wasteland glows under amber haze.  
A single figure stands at its center—alone.

Wind machines whisper through the orchestra pit.

The soprano begins:

> **SOPRANO (O.S.)**  
> _“Sola, perduta, abbandonata in landa desolata…”_  
> _(Alone, lost, abandoned in this desolate land.)_

Her voice climbs the walls, thin as breath, enormous as memory.

---

### **IN THE SKYBOX**

Rexus exhales—barely audible.
His jaw tightens. He doesn't look away from the stage.

(Long beat. The music fills the silence.)

Rexus picks up his glass. Drains it.

Smiles.

**REXUS**  
Let's get the fuck out of here, dude.

Lucian smiles back. Takes a final sip of his champagne.

**LUCIAN**  
Let's do it.

He sets his half-full glass down.

Rexus grabs it. Chugs that too.

Lucian laughs.

They stand. Head for the exit.
