### **INT. SMALL APARTMENT — NIGHT (MULTI-CAM LIVESTREAM SETUP)**

A ring light.  
RGB strip lights.  
Two monitors showing OBS windows.  
A neon sign: “REALITY CHECK CREW – LIVE”.

Three YouTubers sit in gaming chairs:

- **PARKER** (29, sarcastic, fast-talker)
    
- **MIA** (25, chaotic energy, bright pink hoodie)
    
- **TREY** (32, smug, self-proclaimed strategist)
    

A live chat scrolls beside them on the screen.

On the TV behind them, KELSEY’S MELTDOWN plays — the same footage from the cold open.

Kelsey is sobbing into her hands.

The YouTubers??  
They’re _losing it_ laughing.

**PARKER**  
Oh my _god,_ she is still crying.  
This is like — what — day twenty-three?

**MIA**  
Girl’s got two emotions: whining and MORE whining.

**TREY**  
Yeah, if she wanted therapy, maybe don’t sign up for a house with no doors?

Chat explodes:

**CHAT:**  
“lmaoooo Kelsey Cryathon 2025”  
“She’s so fake omg”  
“She acts like her family died 💀”  
“She’s gonna ruin the FEEDS tonight”  
“evict her pls she’s ANNOYING”  
“Blake is 100% putting her on the block”  
“KELSEY GO TOUCH GRASS 😂😂😂”

They read comments aloud, each laughing harder.

**MIA**  
(reading chat)  
“She ugly-cries like a wet possum.”  
Oh my GOD.

**PARKER**  
Kelsey fans in shambles.

**TREY**  
Kelsey fans don’t exist.

They high-five.

Behind them, Kelsey gasps through tears, unable to compose herself.

None of them look at her.

**PARKER**  
Honestly, this is peak Big Brother.  
This is what I pay Paramount+ for.

**TREY**  
Yeah, man.  
Breakdowns and backstabs.  
This is the good stuff.

**MIA**  
Come on, guys, we’ve all had a mental breakdown on camera.  
Right?  
Right???  
(silence from boys)  
…okay, rude.

Chat scrolls:

“she deserves it”  
“stop crying for attention”  
“she wants airtime”  
“cry more, idc”  
“she is literally pathetic”

Trey leans in toward his mic.

**TREY**  
(performative wink)  
Anyway — smash that like button if you want Kelsey out NEXT WEEK.

**MIA**  
Hit subscribe if you want more meltdown content.  
We’ll be covering ALL of it.

**PARKER**  
(raising a drink)  
To reality, baby.

The screen freezes on Kelsey’s face mid-sob as the YouTubers laugh over it.
