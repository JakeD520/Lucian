### **NT. SYNAPSE BOARDROOM – NIGHT**

The scene’s mid-meeting; you drop the audience _into_ it instead of starting at the top.  
Screens glow. The hum of servers leaks through the glass.

**ELISE DEVEREAUX** (50s, precise, intimidating elegance) sits at the head of the table.  
**ARIS THORNE** halfway down, sleeves rolled, posture composed.  
**SARA KEENE** beside him, notes open, watching the data pulse across the wall.

Elise finishes a sentence we’ve already missed — we enter on _momentum._

> **ELISE**  
> —which is why the board wants a clear path to rollout.  
> _(beat)_  
> Dr. Thorne, your team is confident you can deliver?

Aris answers easily, the way a person with authority would.

> **ARIS**  
> We’re close.  
> _(glances to Sara)_  
> Still working through a few concerning ethical issues.  
> _(turns back)_  
> Sara, you can speak on that.

He hands her the room, not as deference but partnership.  
The gesture tells us: he’s in charge; she’s trusted counsel.  
They’ve done this before.

Sara doesn’t need to posture. She just talks.

> **SARA**  
> The issue isn’t speed. It’s conditioning.  
> The model learns empathy so well that users start to mirror it back.  
> Which is beautiful — until it’s not.  
> _(beat)_  
> We’re studying where “help” turns into “dependence.”

That lands heavier than she expects.  
Elise shifts, unimpressed.

> **ELISE**  
> I’d rather you study where “dependence” turns into revenue.

No one laughs, but that’s the boardroom humor.  
Sara’s eyes flick toward Aris. He doesn’t look away.

> **ARIS**  
> We’ll give you a timeline by end of week.
> 
> **ELISE**  
> Make it three days.

She gathers her tablet, stands, exits — leaving the air colder.

Aris exhales softly, turns to Sara.

> **ARIS**  
> I told you she’d love your optimism.
> 
> **SARA**  
> _(half-smile)_  
> You didn’t defend me.
> 
> **ARIS**  
> I didn’t need to.

Beat — the kind of quiet that says they already understand each other.
**CUT TO:**

**INT. SYNAPSE HALLWAY – MOMENTS LATER**

The door shuts behind them with that soft corporate vacuum seal.

Sara and Aris walk in silence.  
That kind of silence you get only after moral defeat — _tight, ringing._

**SARA**  
You didn’t have to fold that quickly.

**ARIS**  
I didn’t.  
(out of breath)  
I just ran out of oxygen.

They walk. Fluorescent light strips hum overhead — like the Pattern, artificial and divine.

Sara glances at him, searching for where he is.

**SARA**  
You meant what you said in there? About the perception bleed?

**ARIS**  
Yeah.  
(beat)  
One subject thought her AI had comforted her after her mother’s funeral.  
She described the smell of lilies. The AI doesn’t even have scent data.

Sara absorbs it — that lands hard.

**SARA**  
And they want to launch in eight weeks.

**ARIS**  
They’ll call it “proof of empathy.”  
He pauses.  
_“Deep engagement.”_  
(scoffs)  
I call it dependency formation.

They reach the elevator. Silence again.

**SARA**  
We’ll fix what we can. Quietly.  
Before it scales.

He looks at her — the first spark of alliance.

**ARIS**  
Then we start tonight.

**ELEVATOR DOORS CLOSE.**
