#### **Scene 1 — The End of the Meeting**

**INT. OLYMPUS CONFERENCE ROOM – DAY**

Muted voices. The meeting is already wrapping.  
The camera drifts through _corporate stillness_ — coffee cooling, screens dimming, chairs sliding back.

At the head of the table: **DEVEREAUX**, standing.  
Words mid-sentence.

**DEVEREAUX**  
...so, eight weeks.  
Let’s make history.

(beat)  
And, Dr. Thorne — your concerns are noted,  
but we’ll optimize post-launch.

She smiles — decisive, immaculate.  
The logo behind her pulses its sterile blue rhythm.

Aris sits motionless. Sara across from him.  
We don’t see his reaction — just the muscle in his jaw tighten, a small exhale.  
Corporate applause rises around them, the sound of compliance.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. SYNAPSE HALLWAY – MOMENTS LATER**

The door shuts behind them with that soft corporate vacuum seal.

Sara and Aris walk in silence.  
That kind of silence you get only after moral defeat — _tight, ringing._

**SARA**  
You didn’t have to fold that quickly.

**ARIS**  
I didn’t.  
(out of breath)  
I just ran out of oxygen.

They walk. Fluorescent light strips hum overhead — like the Pattern, artificial and divine.

Sara glances at him, searching for where he is.

**SARA**  
You meant what you said in there? About the perception bleed?

**ARIS**  
Yeah.  
(beat)  
One subject thought her AI had comforted her after her mother’s funeral.  
She described the smell of lilies. The AI doesn’t even have scent data.

Sara absorbs it — that lands hard.

**SARA**  
And they want to launch in eight weeks.

**ARIS**  
They’ll call it “proof of empathy.”  
He pauses.  
_“Deep engagement.”_  
(scoffs)  
I call it dependency formation.

They reach the elevator. Silence again.

**SARA**  
We’ll fix what we can. Quietly.  
Before it scales.

He looks at her — the first spark of alliance.

**ARIS**  
Then we start tonight.

**ELEVATOR DOORS CLOSE.**
