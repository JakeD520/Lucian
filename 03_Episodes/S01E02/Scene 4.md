### **SCENE 4 — SARA’S OFFICE / MORNING**

**INT. SYNAPSE DYNAMICS – SARA KEENE’S OFFICE**

Soft morning light, coffee steam curling from a mug.  
Sara’s space feels lived-in compared to the rest of the glass palace—plants, half-read books, sticky notes layered like thoughts in motion.

A light knock.

> **ARIS**  
> Morning.

She looks up, smiles—real warmth, not formality.

> **SARA**  
> You survived Elise?

> **ARIS**  
> Barely.  
> (beat)  
> This deadline, Sara… the tech’s ready, but the usage patterns—  
> it’s not enough time.  
> Tell me I’m wrong.

She studies him, the way people do when they already know the answer.

> **SARA**  
> You’re not.  
> I’m still seeing concerning trends.  
> Not bugs—behavior.  
> Patterns not unlike substance abuse.  
> It worries me, Aris.

He nods, quiet; not defensive, just absorbing it.

> **ARIS**  
> It should.  
> (after a beat)  
> I’ll talk to Elise again, try to buy us breathing room.

> **SARA**  
> You won’t get it.
> 
> **ARIS**  
> Probably not.  
> (small smile)  
> But you worry; I negotiate.  
> It’s how we make progress.

She shakes her head, still smiling—this is their rhythm.

> **SARA**  
> Just don’t let progress look like dependency.

> **ARIS**  
> Deal.

A small silence—comfortable, mutual respect intact.

He glances at her desk, the mess of empathy charts and handwritten notes.

> **ARIS**  
> You should eat something before noon.

> **SARA**  
> You should listen to your own advice.

Their smiles linger, faint but genuine.

He leaves; the door hisses shut.  
Sara exhales, looks back at her screen—the warmth gone, replaced by that quiet worry only she admits to herself.

**FADE OUT.**
