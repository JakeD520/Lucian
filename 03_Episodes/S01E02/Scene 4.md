### **INT. SYNAPSE DYNAMICS – ETHICS DIVISION – SARA’S OFFICE**

Sara’s office is messy in a charming way — notebooks stacked, empathy maps sketched on a whiteboard, a mug half-full of cold coffee. The door is open, sunlight drifting across her desk.

She flips through usage data, brow furrowed.  
A soft knock interrupts.

**ARIS**  
Morning.

Sara looks up — surprised but pleased.

**SARA**  
You actually made it out of Elise’s black hole of despair.  
Impressive.

Aris steps in, closes the door halfway — not fully, but enough to create a quieter bubble.

He exhaled on the way here; you can see it.

**ARIS**  
She wants the rollout tightened.  
Again.

Sara rubs her temple.

**SARA**  
Of course she does.  
And the data still looks…  
(gestures vaguely)  
Off.  
Like gravitational pull off.

He nods.  
They both know what she means.

A beat.

**ARIS**  
I’ll go back to her later. Try for more time.

**SARA**  
Aris…  
(small laugh, resigned)  
You’re not going to get it.

**ARIS**  
Yeah. I know.  
(beat)  
But we have to try.

This is familiar territory — the “we push / they push back” dance they’ve done for years.  
But Sara watches him more closely today.

She tilts her head.

**SARA**  
Hey.  
(softer)  
How are _you_ though?

Aris freezes for half a breath — like he wasn’t expecting the question in the middle of metrics and corporate fires.

**ARIS**  
I’m—  
(he searches for accuracy rather than instinct)  
—I’m okay.

Sara raises an eyebrow.

Not buying it.

**SARA**  
Aris.

He exhales — not a breakdown, just… honesty.

**ARIS**  
Last night was…  
(he smiles, self-deprecating)  
long.  
That’s all.

Sara studies him.  
He doesn’t look broken.  
He just looks like a man carrying a lot he won’t set down.

She softens.

**SARA**  
Well…  
you can talk to me, you know.

Aris meets her eyes — the contact holds a beat too long, but neither pulls away.

**ARIS**  
I know.  
(quiet, sincere)  
Thank you.

Sara smiles gently.

**SARA**  
Now sit before you fall over.  
You look like you slept inside a spreadsheet.

**ARIS**  
I did not—  
(beat)  
…completely.

She gives him a look.  
He gives the smallest laugh — rare, but real.

Aris sits.  
The tension in the room dissolves into something warmer.

He glances at her desk — sticky notes about “ethical thresholds,” “user mirroring,” “dependency vectors.”

**ARIS**  
You’re carrying a lot too.

**SARA**  
We’ll figure it out.

**ARIS**  
We always do.

A silence — comfortable, shared.

Then—

Jian’s voice erupts faintly from down the hallway:

**JIAN (O.S.)**  
MARISOL, DON’T GASLIGHT ME, THAT WAS DEFINITELY NOT A PLAIN BAGEL!

Aris and Sara both break into smiles — involuntary, synchronized.

**SARA**  
You want coffee?  
I’m making another round.

**ARIS**  
Yeah.  
Thanks.

He stands to go — then pauses at the doorway.

Turns back.

**ARIS**  
(soft)  
I’m good…  
because you’re here, Sara.

Sara blinks — not flustered, just hit somewhere honest.

A tiny smile.

**SARA**  
Go.  
Before Jian bursts in and kills the moment.

Aris nods, stepping out as Sara returns to her chair — her expression shifting from warmth back to subtle worry, but steadier than before.
