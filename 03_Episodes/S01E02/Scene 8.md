**LUCAN & LYRA — CLEAN SCRIPT VERSION (NO ROMANCE, SIBLING BOND)**

Lyra steps closer, studying him with concern.

LYRA  
Lucian.

There’s a subtle tension in her voice — familiar, but with a faint discord he isn’t used to hearing.

Lucian meets her eyes. Something in her gaze makes his pulse tighten.

Lyra lifts a hand toward his face, hesitates, then rests it on his shoulder instead. The uncertainty in the movement is unlike her.

LYRA  
Just now… I felt you drift somewhere I couldn’t follow.  
Your harmony shifted.  
Like silence where music should be.

Lucian’s jaw flexes. He doesn’t deny it.

Lyra steps closer.

LYRA  
Even the smallest changes in you matter to me.  
They’re not small — they’re significant.

Lucian exhales, grounding himself.

LUCIAN  
Your connection to me runs deeper than anything I could hide.  
But there are shadows I won’t let touch the light in your eyes.

He looks down for a beat — the admission heavier than he wants it to be.

LUCIAN  
I held certainty for millennia.  
I don’t know what it means that… it’s slipping.

Lyra steps back a half-step, giving him space while staying fully present.

She studies him with focused attention.

LYRA  
Lucian… you carry more weight than most beings can comprehend.  
You’re the First Light.  
You saw everything begin.  
Of course your depths run farther than anything I can always track.

Her expression softens, thoughtful.

LYRA  
Sometimes I wonder if my way of seeing things — the small moments, the details — isn’t enough for what you hold.  
Like I’m speaking in sketches when you need someone who works in the architecture of reality.

She reaches toward him, fingertips brushing the fabric of his shirt.

A vulnerable beat.

Then her posture shifts — stronger, clearer.

LYRA  
But Lucian… who told you I need to be protected from what you carry?

Lucian lifts his eyes to hers.

LYRA  
We came into this existence together.  
I’m not fragile.  
I’m not made of starlight and wishes.

Her hand presses more firmly to his arm.

LYRA  
I’ve stood with you at the birth of galaxies.  
Through the death of stars.  
Through every rise and fall.  
Don’t treat me like I’m going to break if you let me see the truth.

Her voice steadies, unwavering.

LYRA  
Whatever shadows you’re carrying — I can hold them.  
I’m your equal.  
You don’t get to shut me out “for my sake.”

Silence.

Lucian watches her — surprised, disarmed, almost amused.

A slow smile breaks across his face.

LUCIAN  
I’ve debated cosmic intelligences older than half this reality…  
and none of them ever called me out like that.

Lyra snorts and gives him a light shove.

LYRA  
Is that what we're calling your tendency to brood dramatically and make unilateral decisions about what I can handle?

Lucian laughs — a genuine one.

He settles, expression softening.

LUCIAN  
You’re right.  
You’ve stood with me through everything.  
Your strength was never the question.

He hesitates — then admits the real truth.

LUCIAN  
It was mine.  
I wasn’t ready to be seen… uncertain.

He lets out a slow breath. Something in him loosens.

He finally looks at her without filtering anything.
