**SCENE 8 — SERIM / LYRA’S GARDEN (LATER)**

**EXT. SERIM – THE GARDEN OF LIGHT / NIGHT WITHOUT DARKNESS**

The same setting as before, but changed.  
The air trembles; the water’s glow is uneven. Some blossoms have closed.

Lyra kneels at the pool’s edge, fingers hovering above the light.  
A subtle distortion moves through the surface — a presence forming before Lucian arrives.

He steps into the frame, posture heavier than before.  
No greeting this time, just silence.

> **LYRA**  
> (quietly)  
> I felt the fracture before you appeared.
> 
> **LUCIAN**  
> It’s nothing. Just noise.

> **LYRA**  
> You’ve never been one for denial.

He half smiles, sits opposite her across the water.  
The reflection between them is fractured — two images that never align.

> **LUCIAN**  
> The world below is slipping. Not in grand cataclysm, but in spirit.  
> Their wonder thinning into mimicry.

> **LYRA**  
> You’ve watched too long again. It bruises you every time.

> **LUCIAN**  
> How do you not feel it?  
> The ache of creation being… rehearsed?

She studies him — worry and admiration intertwined.

> **LYRA**  
> I do feel it.  
> I just don’t let it rewrite me.

He looks away; the fissures of light along his form pulse faintly.

> **LYRA (cont’d)**  
> You’re carrying it all, aren’t you?  
> Their confusion, their noise.
> 
> **LUCIAN**  
> Someone has to listen.

The water between them quivers — sympathy or warning.

Lyra reaches across, her hand hovering above the pool; faint tendrils of light bridge the gap.

> **LYRA**  
> Then listen to me.  
> You are not alone, old friend.

He finally meets her gaze.  
The trembling stops. The light steadies.

> **LUCIAN**  
> (softly)  
> For now.

The line lands like the quiet after thunder — no resolution, just acknowledgment.  
They sit there, hands nearly touching, the calm restored but temporary.

**FADE OUT.**
