### **SCENE 5 — SERIM / LYRA’S GARDEN**

**EXT. SERIM – THE GARDEN OF LIGHT**

The eternal dusk is soft here.  
Light gathers in pools along the stone paths; air carries a faint hum, almost music.

Lyra tends to a line of glowing blossoms. When she looks up, **Lucian** is already there at the edge of her sanctuary.  
They don’t startle each other—old rhythm, old comfort.

> **LYRA**  
> You move quieter every century.
> 
> **LUCIAN**  
> Or you’ve just learned to listen better.

She smiles, waves him closer.  
He hesitates—respect for her space—then steps onto the garden path.

> **LYRA**  
> What brings you to my corner of eternity?
> 
> **LUCIAN**  
> Thought I’d borrow your calm. It’s quieter than the others.

She tilts her head, reading him.

> **LYRA**  
> You’re thinking too loudly again.

> **LUCIAN**  
> Only of what’s ahead. Nothing dire.

A shared glance; she doesn’t believe him, but lets it pass.

> **LYRA**  
> Then sit. Let the quiet do the work.

He does. They sit side by side on the low stone edge, silence stretching—not awkward, just long enough for the air itself to change temperature.

> **LUCIAN**  
> It’s good to see you, Lyra.
> 
> **LYRA**  
> Always, Lucian.

They watch the light shimmer across the water—two ancient friends, stillness shared, the storm not yet spoken.

**FADE OUT.**
