**INT. SYNAPSE DYNAMICS – EXECUTIVE SUITE – NIGHT**

The building hums in its low-power mode — a soft electronic heartbeat.  
Sara’s office glows in a pool of warm desk-lamp light, the door half-open.

A thin stream of **cheap mid-2000s pop** leaks into the hallway — bubbly, earnest, unapologetically dated.

Sara sits curled in her chair: shoes off, hair let down, one foot tucked under her.  
A carton of Chinese takeout balances beside her laptop.  
Chopsticks in one hand, she scrolls with the other, mouthing along to the chorus.

**ELEVATOR DINGS.**

A beat later, **RILEY**, early 20s, junior comms analyst, strolls past — eyes glued to his phone.  
He slows… stops… listens.

**RILEY**  
Is that… _Hilary Duff_?

Sara jumps, nearly flinging her lo mein.

**SARA**  
(embarrassed, defensive)  
It’s called nostalgia, Riley.  
Very advanced concept. You wouldn’t understand.

**RILEY**  
(grinning)  
Sure. Just didn’t have you pegged for “mall-pop after hours.”

**SARA**  
Hey, I'm cultured.  
Now go home. People who aren’t me sleep.

Riley laughs, gives a salute, and disappears down the hall.

The music keeps playing for a beat — cheerfully oblivious.

Sara sighs, shakes her head, hits **pause**.

Silence drops in like a blanket.  
Too heavy.  
Too sudden.

She turns back to her laptop.

Multiple dashboards glow in the dark — sentiment graphs, heat maps, anonymized transcripts.  
The innocuous front-end of something immense.

She scrolls.  
Her posture changes.  
Shoulders draw in, brow tightens.

Fragments of conversation — blurred, unreadable to us — flash across the screen.

Her expression shifts from analytical… to concerned… to unsettled.

Sara reaches for her cold tea, stops halfway, sets it back down.

**SARA**  
(under her breath)  
…that's not good.

She leans closer, eyes narrowing.

Whatever she’s seeing, it’s wrong.

**HOLD ON SARA** — the fun drained out, replaced by a growing, quiet dread.

### **FADE OUT.**
