### **SCENE 6 — SARA / OFFICE – LATE NIGHT**

**INT. SYNAPSE DYNAMICS – EXECUTIVE SUITE**

Lights dimmed to night mode; the building hums quietly around her.  
Sara’s office door is half-open, the faint sound of _cheap pop music_ spilling into the corridor — something unapologetically uncool, mid-2000s upbeat.

She’s at her desk, shoes off, hair loose, carton of Chinese takeout balanced beside her laptop.  
She eats with chopsticks in one hand, scrolling with the other, mouthing a lyric between bites.

The _elevator dings._

A colleague passes by — **RILEY**, a junior comms analyst, caught mid-scroll on his phone. He freezes at the sound of the music.

> **RILEY**  
> …is that _Hilary Duff?_

Sara startles, nearly drops the chopsticks.

> **SARA**  
> (defensive grin)  
> It’s called nostalgia, Riley. Look it up.

> **RILEY**  
> Right. Just… didn’t have you pegged for karaoke night.

> **SARA**  
> That’s because I’m mysterious and layered.  
> Go home. Normal people sleep.

He laughs, waves good-night, disappears down the hall.  
She exhales, shakes her head, hits pause on the music.  
The sudden quiet feels _too quiet._

Sara turns back to her laptop — several dashboards open, bright in the dark.  
Lines of metrics, sentiment maps, usage trends — nothing explained, but the shapes tell their own story.

Her smile fades.  
She leans closer, squinting. The cursor hovers, a slow scroll through a page of anonymized transcripts — fragments of human conversation.

We can’t see what’s written, just her expression shifting — surprise, then concern.

She reaches for her cold tea, doesn’t drink it.  
The music’s silence hangs like a held breath.

> **SARA**  
> (quietly, to herself)  
> …that’s not supposed to happen.

The screen’s glow flickers across her face; whatever she’s reading, it unsettles her more than she wants to admit.

**HOLD ON HER** — the fun fading to focus, the warmth giving way to quiet unease.

**FADE OUT.**
