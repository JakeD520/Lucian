# ⭐ **COLD OPEN – “BIG BROTHER: SEASON 34” DIARY ROOM CONFESSIONAL**

### **INT. BIG BROTHER DIARY ROOM – NIGHT**

Harsh neon lighting. Saturated colors.  
That signature padded chair.  
The ever-present microphone rustle.

**KELSEY MARA** (31, Midwest, athletic build, mascara smudged into gray half-moons) sits stiffly in the chair.  
She looks like she’s been holding herself together for hours… and it’s not going well.

She tries to smile for the camera.  
It’s shaky.  
Already failing.

**KELSEY**  
(trying to lighten it)  
I—I know America’s watching.  
So I’m supposed to, you know…  
(smiles harder; too hard)  
keep it cute.

A brittle laugh.  
She swallows.

**KELSEY**  
But I…  
I really embarrassed myself today.  
And…  
(voice wobbles)  
I keep thinking about what my family’s gonna think.

Her eyes burn; she tries blinking the tears back aggressively.

**KELSEY**  
Like—  
(pulls breath; rambling)  
My mom raised me better than this.  
My dad—  
God, he’s probably sitting at home shaking his head like, “Kels, what the hell are you doing?”  
And my sisters—  
(blinks rapidly)  
I can _hear_ them laughing at me.

Her voice shrinks.

**KELSEY**  
I’m just…  
I’m ashamed of how I handled myself.  
And it’s so stupid because I KNOW this house messes with you.  
Everyone keeps telling me that.  
But—  
I still feel like I’m…  
failing at being a person.

She breathes sharply, trying to regroup.  
Doesn’t work.

A tear breaks loose.

Kelsey fans her face with both hands, fast and desperate.

**KELSEY**  
No—no, no, no—  
Stop.  
Stop, Kels.  
Stop crying.  
Come on.  
Come ON.

She inhales through her nose.  
Holds it.  
Forces a smile.

It drops immediately.

**KELSEY**  
(tiny, defeated)  
I’m trying.  
I swear.  
I’m trying so hard.

Her voice gives out.  
Just… gives.

She folds forward, elbows on knees, hands over her face.

And she **breaks**.

Not TV-pretty crying.  
Not dramatic.  
Not performative.

Just a woman sobbing into her palms, shoulders shaking uncontrollably, breath stuttering, mascara pooling at her chin.

The camera **does not cut away**.  
It lingers.

Longer than comfortable.

Longer than kind.

Kelsey gasps between sobs — that fragile, involuntary sound of someone truly coming undone.

We sit with it.  
Held.  
Witnessing.

Human pain as product.

### **SMASH CUT TO:**

### **INT. SUBURBAN LIVING ROOM – NIGHT**

A totally ordinary house.

A couple sits on a couch, TV casting harsh reality show light across their faces.

**MARK** (40, beer resting on belly) watches casually.  
**JESS** (late 30s, scrolling on her phone) glances up at the screen.

On the TV: Kelsey still crying, face buried in her hands.

**JESS**  
Ugh.  
She’s _always_ crying.  
(swipes her phone)  
I hope she goes home this week.

**MARK**  
(chuckles)  
Yeah.  
She’s a mess.

Kelsey sobs harder on the screen — unheard.

Jess refreshes her feed.

Mark takes another sip of beer.

They watch.  
Or don’t.

Totally unmoved.
