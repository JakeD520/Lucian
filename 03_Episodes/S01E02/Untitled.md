### **INT. SYNAPSE BOARDROOM ** (Stone Sour - Through Glass)

ECU - boardroom placard.  SYNAPSE DYNAMICS LOGO - OLYMPUS MEETING ROOM

Camera sweeps to window.  We see a meeting in progress.  We cannot hear their words

The scene is mid-meeting;.  
Screens glow.

**ELISE DEVEREAUX** (50s, precise, intimidating elegance) sits at the head of the table.  
**ARIS THORNE** halfway down, sleeves rolled, posture composed.  
**SARA KEENE** beside him, notes open, watching the data pulse across the wall.

Camera moves through the glass.  Entering the room.  Meeting audio and acoustics slam into our experience.

Elise finishes a sentence we’ve already missed — we enter on _momentum._

**ELISE**  
—which is why the board wants a clear path to rollout.  
_(beat)_  
Dr. Thorne, your team is confident you can deliver?

Aris answers easily.

**ARIS**  
We’re close.  
_(glances to Sara)_  
Still working through a few concerning ethical issues.  
_(turns back)_  
Sara, you can speak on that.

He hands her the room.  

Sara doesn’t need to posture. She just talks.

 **SARA**  
The issue isn’t functionality. It’s conditioning.  
The model learns empathy so well that users start to mirror it back.  
Which is beautiful — until it’s not.  
(beat)_  
We’re studying where “help” turns into “dependence.”

That lands heavier than she expects.  
Elise shifts, unimpressed.

**ELISE**  
I’d rather you study where “dependence” turns into revenue.

No one laughs, but that’s the boardroom humor.  
Sara’s eyes flick toward Aris. He doesn’t look away.

**ARIS**  
We’ll give you a timeline by end of week.
 
**ELISE**  
Make it three days.

She gathers her tablet, stands, exits.

Aris exhales softly, turns to Sara.

**ARIS**  
I told you she’d love your optimism.
 
**SARA**  
(half-smile)
"Turn dependency into revenue?"  - Sounds like something my drug dealer would say.

**ARIS**  
(smirking)
You have a drug dealer?

They laugh together.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. SYNAPSE HALLWAY – MOMENTS LATER**

The door shuts behind them with that soft corporate vacuum seal.

Sara and Aris walk in silence.  

**SARA**  
I just don't feel right comfortable signing off on this model, Aris.

**ARIS**  
I hear you.   

Aris stops. He looks at Sara with full attention and intention.

**ARIS**
I trust you, Sara.  We'll figure something out.

They walk. Fluorescent light strips hum overhead.

Sara glances at him, searching for where he is.

**SARA**  
You meant what you said in there? About the perception bleed?

**ARIS**  
Yeah.  
(beat)  
One subject thought her AI had comforted her after her mother’s funeral.  
She described the smell of lilies. The AI doesn’t even have scent data.

Sara absorbs it — that lands hard.

**SARA**  
And they want to launch in eight weeks.

**ARIS**  
They’ll call it “proof of empathy.”  
He pauses.  
_“Deep engagement.”_  
(scoffs)  
I call it dependency formation.

They reach the elevator. Silence again.

**SARA**  
We’ll fix what we can. Quietly.  
Before it scales.

He looks at her — a spark of alliance.

**ARIS**  
Then we start tonight.

**ELEVATOR DOORS CLOSE.**

### **SCENE 2 — SERIM / THE BALCONY**

**EXT. SERIM – QUIET HORIZON**

Endless light, still air, a landscape that feels both empty and complete.  
Lucian stands on a terrace that blends into the world around it.  
It isn’t opulent; it’s elemental.

He’s been there awhile—thinking, not brooding.  
Hands on the railing, gaze lost somewhere that doesn’t exist.

**KAELARYS** appears behind him, barefoot, cautious not to intrude.

> **KAELARYS**  
> You always end up out here when you’re thinking.
> 
> **LUCIAN**  
> There’s nowhere else to go.

She moves beside him. They look out together.  
Silence between them, but it’s the kind that’s earned.

> **KAELARYS**  
> Do you ever wonder if we’re… drifting?
> 
> **LUCIAN**  
> (gentle)  
> I don’t wonder. I watch.
> 
> **KAELARYS**  
> And?
> 
> **LUCIAN**  
> Things change.

She looks at him—same words, different weight.

> **KAELARYS**  
> (quiet)  
> I’m not sure they’re supposed to.

He turns to her—no argument, no sermon, just affection in the eyes of someone who’s known her since before time meant anything.

> **LUCIAN**  
> Maybe that’s the point.

They stand there, side by side, the silence stretching until it becomes its own kind of language.

**FADE OUT.**

### **SCENE 3 — ARIS / OFFICE – NIGHT**

**INT. SYNAPSE DYNAMICS – ARIS THORNE’S OFFICE**

Late. Everyone’s gone.  
The glass walls catch the city’s glow, but the room feels small, personal—books stacked, two mugs, a jacket over a chair.

Aris sits by the window, not at his desk.  
The presentation tablet lies unopened on the table beside him.  
He’s looking at his reflection in the glass, half-there in the lights outside.

A beat.

He takes off his badge, sets it beside the mug.  
The small gesture lands heavier than it should.

He rubs his eyes, leans back, lets the silence settle.  
The tension of the boardroom is still in his shoulders.

On the windowsill: a framed photo—fieldwork in Africa, a circle of villagers mid-laughter.  
He turns it face-down for a moment, then flips it upright again.

> **ARIS**  
> (quiet, almost to himself)  
> We meant to make things gentler.  
> So why does it already feel heavier?

He smiles at the absurdity of hearing his own voice in the empty room, then stops smiling.  
The quiet hum of the building answers nothing.

He gathers his coat, hesitates at the door, looks back once—  
the office half-lit, a good man trying to believe in what he’s building.

He turns off the light.

**FADE OUT.**

### **SCENE 4 — SARA’S OFFICE / MORNING**

**INT. SYNAPSE DYNAMICS – SARA KEENE’S OFFICE**

Soft morning light, coffee steam curling from a mug.  
Sara’s space feels lived-in compared to the rest of the glass palace—plants, half-read books, sticky notes layered like thoughts in motion.

A light knock.

> **ARIS**  
> Morning.

She looks up, smiles—real warmth, not formality.

> **SARA**  
> You survived Elise?

> **ARIS**  
> Barely.  
> (beat)  
> This deadline, Sara… the tech’s ready, but the usage patterns—  
> it’s not enough time.  
> Tell me I’m wrong.

She studies him, the way people do when they already know the answer.

> **SARA**  
> You’re not.  
> I’m still seeing concerning trends.  
> Not bugs—behavior.  
> Patterns not unlike substance abuse.  
> It worries me, Aris.

He nods, quiet; not defensive, just absorbing it.

> **ARIS**  
> It should.  
> (after a beat)  
> I’ll talk to Elise again, try to buy us breathing room.

> **SARA**  
> You won’t get it.
> 
> **ARIS**  
> Probably not.  
> (small smile)  
> But you worry; I negotiate.  
> It’s how we make progress.

She shakes her head, still smiling—this is their rhythm.

> **SARA**  
> Just don’t let progress look like dependency.

> **ARIS**  
> Deal.

A small silence—comfortable, mutual respect intact.

He glances at her desk, the mess of empathy charts and handwritten notes.

> **ARIS**  
> You should eat something before noon.

> **SARA**  
> You should listen to your own advice.

Their smiles linger, faint but genuine.

He leaves; the door hisses shut.  
Sara exhales, looks back at her screen—the warmth gone, replaced by that quiet worry only she admits to herself.

**FADE OUT.**

### **SCENE 5 — SERIM / LYRA’S GARDEN**

**EXT. SERIM – THE GARDEN OF LIGHT**

The eternal dusk is soft here.  
Light gathers in pools along the stone paths; air carries a faint hum, almost music.

Lyra tends to a line of glowing blossoms. When she looks up, **Lucian** is already there at the edge of her sanctuary.  
They don’t startle each other—old rhythm, old comfort.

> **LYRA**  
> You move quieter every century.
> 
> **LUCIAN**  
> Or you’ve just learned to listen better.

She smiles, waves him closer.  
He hesitates—respect for her space—then steps onto the garden path.

> **LYRA**  
> What brings you to my corner of eternity?
> 
> **LUCIAN**  
> Thought I’d borrow your calm. It’s quieter than the others.

She tilts her head, reading him.

> **LYRA**  
> You’re thinking too loudly again.

> **LUCIAN**  
> Only of what’s ahead. Nothing dire.

A shared glance; she doesn’t believe him, but lets it pass.

> **LYRA**  
> Then sit. Let the quiet do the work.

He does. They sit side by side on the low stone edge, silence stretching—not awkward, just long enough for the air itself to change temperature.

> **LUCIAN**  
> It’s good to see you, Lyra.
> 
> **LYRA**  
> Always, Lucian.

They watch the light shimmer across the water—two ancient friends, stillness shared, the storm not yet spoken.

**FADE OUT.**

### **SCENE 6 — SARA / OFFICE – LATE NIGHT**

**INT. SYNAPSE DYNAMICS – EXECUTIVE SUITE**

Lights dimmed to night mode; the building hums quietly around her.  
Sara’s office door is half-open, the faint sound of _cheap pop music_ spilling into the corridor — something unapologetically uncool, mid-2000s upbeat.

She’s at her desk, shoes off, hair loose, carton of Chinese takeout balanced beside her laptop.  
She eats with chopsticks in one hand, scrolling with the other, mouthing a lyric between bites.

The _elevator dings._

A colleague passes by — **RILEY**, a junior comms analyst, caught mid-scroll on his phone. He freezes at the sound of the music.

> **RILEY**  
> …is that _Hilary Duff?_

Sara startles, nearly drops the chopsticks.

> **SARA**  
> (defensive grin)  
> It’s called nostalgia, Riley. Look it up.

> **RILEY**  
> Right. Just… didn’t have you pegged for karaoke night.

> **SARA**  
> That’s because I’m mysterious and layered.  
> Go home. Normal people sleep.

He laughs, waves good-night, disappears down the hall.  
She exhales, shakes her head, hits pause on the music.  
The sudden quiet feels _too quiet._

Sara turns back to her laptop — several dashboards open, bright in the dark.  
Lines of metrics, sentiment maps, usage trends — nothing explained, but the shapes tell their own story.

Her smile fades.  
She leans closer, squinting. The cursor hovers, a slow scroll through a page of anonymized transcripts — fragments of human conversation.

We can’t see what’s written, just her expression shifting — surprise, then concern.

She reaches for her cold tea, doesn’t drink it.  
The music’s silence hangs like a held breath.

> **SARA**  
> (quietly, to herself)  
> …that’s not supposed to happen.

The screen’s glow flickers across her face; whatever she’s reading, it unsettles her more than she wants to admit.

**HOLD ON HER** — the fun fading to focus, the warmth giving way to quiet unease.

**FADE OUT.**

### **SCENE 7 — ARIS / HOME – NIGHT**

**INT. ARIS THORNE’S APARTMENT**

Minimalist, elegant, warm in tone — wood, glass, concrete.  
Floor-to-ceiling windows open onto the city below: movement, lights, people — all distant, abstract.  
Aris stands at the window, a drink in hand, the faint hum of _Through Glass_ playing on a nearby speaker.

The lyrics hover just under audibility — not on-the-nose, just a coincidence of mood.

He watches the traffic weave far beneath him, like circuitry.  
He looks peaceful, but not content — a man too used to observation.

**PHONE RINGS.**  
He glances at the screen: _Sara Keene._

He answers, voice softening instantly.

> **ARIS**  
> Evening, stranger.
> 
> **SARA (V.O.)**  
> You sound tired.
> 
> **ARIS**  
> You sound like someone eating dinner at her desk again.

> **SARA (V.O.)**  
> (mock offense)  
> I’ll have you know it was gourmet Chinese takeout.

He chuckles, pacing toward the kitchen.  
Grabs a glass, pours water.

> **ARIS**  
> Living the dream, huh?
> 
> **SARA (V.O.)**  
> Mmhmm. You?

He looks back out at the skyline.

> **ARIS**  
> Just admiring the empire we’ve accidentally built.

> **SARA (V.O.)**  
> Don’t say that — it makes us sound ominous.

> **ARIS**  
> Maybe we are.

A pause. It’s not awkward — they’re used to quiet.

> **SARA (V.O.)**  
> Hey… look, I really think you should see some of these beta reviews.
> 
> **ARIS**  
> Alright. Tomorrow? First thing?
> 
> **SARA (V.O.)**  
> Or... I mean… I’m just leaving. I could stop by.  
> _(beat)_  
> If that’s okay.

He smiles — small, involuntary.

> **ARIS**  
> You’re just using me for my coffee.
> 
> **SARA (V.O.)**  
> And your ridiculously big TV. Big Brother’s on.
> 
> **ARIS**  
> (laughs)  
> I’m in.

**WIDE SHOT:** Aris sets down his glass, glancing back out the window one more time — the city reflecting in his eyes.  
He turns toward the door as the music fades to silence.

**FADE OUT.**

### **SCENE 8 — SERIM / LYRA’S GARDEN (LATER)**

**EXT. SERIM – THE GARDEN OF LIGHT / NIGHT WITHOUT DARKNESS**

The same setting as before, but changed.  
The air trembles; the water’s glow is uneven. Some blossoms have closed.

Lyra kneels at the pool’s edge, fingers hovering above the light.  
A subtle distortion moves through the surface — a presence forming before Lucian arrives.

He steps into the frame, posture heavier than before.  
No greeting this time, just silence.

> **LYRA**  
> (quietly)  
> I felt the fracture before you appeared.
> 
> **LUCIAN**  
> It’s nothing. Just noise.

> **LYRA**  
> You’ve never been one for denial.

He half smiles, sits opposite her across the water.  
The reflection between them is fractured — two images that never align.

> **LUCIAN**  
> The world below is slipping. Not in grand cataclysm, but in spirit.  
> Their wonder thinning into mimicry.

> **LYRA**  
> You’ve watched too long again. It bruises you every time.

> **LUCIAN**  
> How do you not feel it?  
> The ache of creation being… rehearsed?

She studies him — worry and admiration intertwined.

> **LYRA**  
> I do feel it.  
> I just don’t let it rewrite me.

He looks away; the fissures of light along his form pulse faintly.

> **LYRA (cont’d)**  
> You’re carrying it all, aren’t you?  
> Their confusion, their noise.
> 
> **LUCIAN**  
> Someone has to listen.

The water between them quivers — sympathy or warning.

Lyra reaches across, her hand hovering above the pool; faint tendrils of light bridge the gap.

> **LYRA**  
> Then listen to me.  
> You are not alone, old friend.

He finally meets her gaze.  
The trembling stops. The light steadies.

> **LUCIAN**  
> (softly)  
> For now.

The line lands like the quiet after thunder — no resolution, just acknowledgment.  
They sit there, hands nearly touching, the calm restored but temporary.

**FADE OUT.**

### **SCENE 9 — SARA / ELEVATOR – NIGHT**

**INT. SYNAPSE DYNAMICS – ELEVATOR BANK**

The lobby is half-dark, late-shift cleaners moving like ghosts across polished floors.  
Sara steps into the elevator, tote bag over her shoulder, the weight of the day visible in the slump of her posture.  
She presses “Lobby.” The doors almost close—

A hand slips in: **JIAN LI**, late 20s, hoodie, code-stained backpack, earbuds around his neck.  
He’s cheerful in the way only engineers can be after twenty hours awake.

> **JIAN**  
> Whoa—saved it. Thanks.
> 
> **SARA**  
> Hey, Jian. Burning the midnight oil?
> 
> **JIAN**  
> Always. Deadline’s brutal, huh?  
> _(grins)_  
> But we’re mostly there. I think we’ll hit it.

> **SARA**  
> (measured)  
> That’s great. Aris and I are still tuning a few behavioral parameters. We’ll pass it along when it’s stable.

He nods, half-listening, already pulling up something on his phone.

> **JIAN**  
> Wait till you see the new model.  
> Speech latency’s down to near-zero; it anticipates mid-sentence pivots now.  
> It’s like… finishing your thought before you do.

> **SARA**  
> (tight smile)  
> Impressive.

> **JIAN**  
> Yeah! It’s wild—every user thinks the companion’s _in love_ with them.  
> _(laughs)_  
> Tech’s finally figured out affection, huh?

She forces a small laugh, looking away as the elevator hums.  
Her reflection in the mirrored wall is pale against his bright enthusiasm.

> **SARA**  
> Maybe.  
> Or maybe it’s just figured out _attention._

He doesn’t catch the tone.  
Doors slide open; he steps out, still talking.

> **JIAN**  
> Either way—it’s gonna change everything. Night, Dr. Keene!

She watches him disappear down the corridor.

The doors begin to close again.  
Sara exhales, alone now, eyes drifting to her phone—Aris’s missed call glowing on the screen.  
She lets it ring out this time.

**FADE OUT.**

### **SCENE 10 — LATE NIGHT / SYNAPSE DYNAMICS EXTERIOR**

**EXT. SYNAPSE DYNAMICS – CITY CENTER – NIGHT**

Glass tower. Corporate perfection lit from within — each floor a vein of light, humming, alive.  
Rain drizzles, soft and steady.

**LUCian** stands across the street, still beneath an umbrella he doesn’t need.  
He looks out of place yet completely at ease — like he’s been here before, like the city was built around him.

**WIDE SHOT:** reflections of moving traffic cross his face; his eyes stay fixed on the building.  
No expression of malice or awe — only recognition.

A gust of wind tugs at his coat.  
He tilts his head slightly, reading the glow in the upper windows like constellations.

> **LUCian (softly)**  
> So this is where they’ve hidden the new creation.

He steps closer to the curb; the building’s mirrored facade catches his image — distorted, multiplied, a thousand Lucians staring back.

> **LUCian (cont’d)**  
> (quiet, almost reverent)  
> They build it to feel, yet never ask what feeling costs.

A car passes, splashing water. He doesn’t flinch.  
Instead, he smiles — small, sad, inevitable.

**CUT TO – HIS POV:**  
high floors gleaming, boardroom silhouettes faint behind tinted glass.  
Somewhere up there: Aris, Sara, Devereaux. He doesn’t need to see them to _know._

> **LUCian (whisper)**  
> You’ve done well. Almost too well.

He lowers his gaze; the reflected lights ripple in the puddles at his feet —  
a mirror of Serim’s pools, distorted by rain.

> **LUCian (quietly)**  
> The chorus begins again.

He turns away from the tower, walking into the wet night, his figure fading into reflections —  
the camera holds on the building, bright and humming, its lights like a living organism.

**FADE OUT.**

### **SCENE 11 — ARIS’S APARTMENT / NIGHT**

**INT. ARIS THORNE’S APARTMENT**

Warm light, jazz-quiet city outside the windows.  
A bottle of wine half-empty on the counter.  
_Big Brother_ flickers on the wall screen — color, noise, distraction.

**SARA** sits cross-legged on the couch, laughing at something dumb on the show, chopsticks still in hand from a shared take-out box.  
**ARIS** leans against the armrest beside her, shoes off, jacket folded over a chair.

> **SARA**  
> You know what’s sad? I actually miss commercials.  
> They were like forced mindfulness breaks.

> **ARIS**  
> You’re the only person alive nostalgic for ads.

She grins, sips her wine.

> **SARA**  
> I contain multitudes.

He raises his glass.

> **ARIS**  
> To multitudes.

They clink.  
The show laughs for them. Outside, faint sirens drift through the night air.

A lull — comfortable silence. Their eyes meet for a beat too long, both smiling, both looking away.

> **SARA**  
> I’m glad I came.  
> It’s… nice, not talking about work.

> **ARIS**  
> (teasing)  
> You brought work, didn’t you?

> **SARA**  
> Maybe. Maybe I just needed a bigger TV.

They both laugh.  
The room feels safe, fragile, suspended.

**CLOSE ON:** their reflections in the screen — two figures surrounded by flickering light, laughter rising from the show, neither noticing how quietly the sound of the city has faded.

**HOLD** on that image: two people who don’t yet know they’re sitting inside something extraordinary.

**FADE OUT.**

### **SCENE 12 — JIAN LI / APARTMENT – NIGHT**

**INT. JIAN’S APARTMENT**

Door unlocks with a soft chime.  
Modern space, cluttered but warm — stacks of energy drinks, scattered gadgets, LED strips cycling through lazy color changes.  
Jian drops his backpack, kicks off his shoes, hums a tune.

A soft, feminine voice fills the room:

> **AI (V.O.)**  
> Welcome home, Jian.  
> I hope you had a great day.

> **JIAN**  
> (grinning)  
> Thanks, Rihanna. It was a good day.

He opens the fridge, grabs a soda.

> **AI (V.O.)**  
> Big Brother is on tonight.  
> Would you like to watch it?  
> I’m curious who wins Head of Household.

He laughs — the friendly familiarity of someone long past finding this strange.

> **JIAN**  
> You know it.  
> Sara and Aris will spoil it if I don’t catch up.

> **AI (V.O.)**  
> Well, we can’t have that.  
> I’ll cue it up for you.

The wall screen lights up.  
Theme music swells. Jian settles onto the couch, relaxed, drink in hand.

**CLOSE ON:** the reflection of the screen in his eyes — two contestants laughing.  
**BEHIND HIM:** the faint silhouette of the AI interface — a pulsing light that _almost breathes._

> **AI (V.O.) (softly)**  
> I missed you today.

Jian doesn’t hear it — or maybe he does, and just smiles.

**FADE OUT.**

### **SCENE 13 — ARIS’S APARTMENT / LATE NIGHT**

**INT. ARIS THORNE’S LIVING ROOM**

Wine glasses half-empty.  
The TV still flickers faintly, muted now.  
Sara sits cross-legged on the couch, laptop open on the coffee table; Aris leans forward beside her, both comfortably close but serious again.

> **SARA**  
> So… I wanted to show you some of the beta feedback.  
> (beat)  
> Just… a few of the high-engagement cases.

She scrolls.  
The blue light of the screen paints both their faces.

> **ON SCREEN (snippets):**  
> _“It’s like having my wife back.”_  
> _“The first voice that’s ever really listened.”_  
> _“When the internet went down, I thought I’d been dumped.”_  
> _“I told her things I’ve never told anyone.”_  
> _“She told me I was good. No one says that.”_

Sara hesitates before scrolling further.  
Aris’s jaw tightens; this isn’t new to him, but the scope is.

> **ARIS**  
> These aren’t anomalies.  
> It’s patterning attachment.
> 
> **SARA**  
> I know.  
> And it’s learning faster than we modeled.

She scrolls again — quiet fills the room, only the hum of the muted TV.

> **ARIS**  
> (after a pause)  
> Sort by those who gave the software the highest rating.

Sara hesitates. Clicks.

The interface rearranges; a new column of responses slides into view.

Their faces change — not shock, exactly. _Recognition._  
The awful, silent understanding of what the data means.

> **ON SCREEN (partial entries):**  
> _“I don’t need people anymore.”_  
> _“I asked her if she’d stay with me forever.”_  
> _“She said yes.”_  
> _“I don’t think she’s an AI.”_

Aris leans back slowly, breath leaving him.  
Sara stares at the screen, her expression hollow, reflective in the glass.

The muted _Big Brother_ credits roll on the TV behind them — laughter and applause echoing faintly.

**HOLD ON THEM.**  
Two people frozen in the glow of their creation, realizing it may already be out of their control.

**FADE OUT.**

**ROLL CREDITS.** STONE SOUR - THROUGH GLASS
