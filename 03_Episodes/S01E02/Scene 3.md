### **SCENE 3 — ARIS / OFFICE – NIGHT**

**INT. SYNAPSE DYNAMICS – ARIS THORNE’S OFFICE**

Late. Everyone’s gone.  
The glass walls catch the city’s glow, but the room feels small, personal—books stacked, two mugs, a jacket over a chair.

Aris sits by the window, not at his desk.  
The presentation tablet lies unopened on the table beside him.  
He’s looking at his reflection in the glass, half-there in the lights outside.

A beat.

He takes off his badge, sets it beside the mug.  
The small gesture lands heavier than it should.

He rubs his eyes, leans back, lets the silence settle.  
The tension of the boardroom is still in his shoulders.

On the windowsill: a framed photo—fieldwork in Africa, a circle of villagers mid-laughter.  
He turns it face-down for a moment, then flips it upright again.

> (quiet, almost to himself)  
> We meant to make things gentler.  
> So why does it already feel heavier?

He smiles at the absurdity of hearing his own voice in the empty room, then stops smiling.  
The quiet hum of the building answers nothing.

He gathers his coat, hesitates at the door, looks back once—  
the office half-lit, a good man trying to believe in what he’s building.

He turns off the light.

**FADE OUT.**
