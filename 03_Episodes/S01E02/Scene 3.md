 **INT. SYNAPSE DYNAMICS — ARIS THORNE’S OFFICE — NIGHT**

The building rests in low hum.  
Aris’s office glows softly — enough to see, not enough to feel awake.

He’s sitting near the window, slouched slightly, tension still coiled in his shoulders.

The photo on the sill catches a glint of city light.

He looks at it.  
Just looks.

Then — a flicker of shame or exhaustion crosses his expression.  
He reaches out and **turns the frame face-down**.

A beat.

Something about it feels wrong.

Aris stares at the inverted rectangle, frowning — not at the photo, but at himself.

His gaze moves towards the window - his reflection.  He looks deeply at himself.

He reaches out, picks up the frame.

Holds it.

The image:  
Him younger, dusty, laughing in the middle of a village.  
A cluster of children tugging at his sleeve, pulling him into a game.  
One kid’s face mid-laugh, another climbing him like a tree.  
Aris’s own expression — mock exasperation, hand up like _“wait, hold on”_,  
but his smile betrays how much he loves this moment.

Aris touches the glass with two fingers.  
His thumb grazes the younger version of himself — a man who didn’t carry this weight.

A small smile breaks through.  
Brief.  
Real.

He inhales — deeper than before.  
Something in him steadies.

He gently sets the photo back on the sill.  
Not perfectly aligned.  
Just _placed_ — with intention, with softness.

**CUT TO BLACK.**
