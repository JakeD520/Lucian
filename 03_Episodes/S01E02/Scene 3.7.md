**INT. SARA’S APARTMENT – NIGHT**

Quiet. Soft yellow lamps.  
Plants on shelves. A stack of unread books.  
A space that feels **lived in**, not curated.

Sara enters, juggling grocery bags and keys.

She drops the bags on the counter with a relieved exhale.

Without ceremony, she tears open a bag of chips — not dainty, not mindful, just human hunger.  
Crunch.  
Crunch.  
She nods at the taste like, _yeah, that’ll do._

Still munching, she wanders to the TV.  
Turns it on. Navigates the streaming apps.

**TV MENU:**  
→ BIG BROTHER: SEASON 34  
“Episode 19 — Diary Room Chaos”

Sara smiles like she’s finally letting herself sit in her guilty pleasure.

She hits PLAY.

The BB theme begins — loud, ridiculous, iconic.

As the recap montage starts, she pulls out her phone.

We see her screen:

**GROUP CHAT — “Work Team Safe Space”**  
Three avatars: _Sara, Jian, Marisol, Aris_.

Sara types:

**SARA:**  
“Hey guys, finally catching up on Big Brother.”

She walks over to the couch, plops down, chips bag in hand, legs tucked under her comfortably.

Phone pings instantly.

**JIAN:**  
“ABOUT TIME 😂  
We’ve literally been talking in a cone of silence so we wouldn’t spoil anything.”

Sara laughs aloud — small, genuine — almost spilling her chips.

Cuts to the TV:  
A BB contestant arguing in the kitchen, over-the-top dramatic.

Sara shakes her head, grinning.

**CUT TO:**

# ⭐ **INT. SYNAPSE — ARIS’ OFFICE – SAME TIME**

The same room from earlier, now darker.  
Aris sits at his desk finishing nothing — just staring at open files that aren’t moving him.

His phone lights up.  
A notification from the **Work Team Safe Space** chat.

He sees Sara’s message. 

A real smile forms — slow, involuntary, deeper than “work friend” amusement.

He hesitates.

Thumbs hover over the keyboard.

He types:

**ARIS:**  
“Can’t wait to talk to you about it tomorrow.”

He stares at it.  
Something in him shifts — a mix of warmth and restraint.

He holds the thought…

…then taps **delete** until the message disappears.

He sets the phone down — gently, like he’s defusing something fragile inside his chest.

He exhales.

Not sad.  
Not tense.

Just deeply, quietly alive.
