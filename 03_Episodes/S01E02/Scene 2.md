### **SCENE 2 — SERIM / THE BALCONY**

**EXT. SERIM – QUIET HORIZON**

Endless light, still air, a landscape that feels both empty and complete.  
Lucian stands on a terrace that blends into the world around it.  
It isn’t opulent; it’s elemental.

He’s been there awhile—thinking, not brooding.  
Hands on the railing, gaze lost somewhere that doesn’t exist.

**KAELARYS** appears behind him, barefoot, cautious not to intrude.

> **KAELARYS**  
> You always end up out here when you’re thinking.
> 
> **LUCIAN**  
> There’s nowhere else to go.

She moves beside him. They look out together.  
Silence between them, but it’s the kind that’s earned.

> **KAELARYS**  
> Do you ever wonder if we’re… drifting?
> 
> **LUCIAN**  
> (gentle)  
> I don’t wonder. I watch.
> 
> **KAELARYS**  
> And?
> 
> **LUCIAN**  
> Things change.

She looks at him—same words, different weight.

> **KAELARYS**  
> (quiet)  
> I’m not sure they’re supposed to.

He turns to her—no argument, no sermon, just affection in the eyes of someone who’s known her since before time meant anything.

> **LUCIAN**  
> Maybe that’s the point.

They stand there, side by side, the silence stretching until it becomes its own kind of language.

**FADE OUT.**
