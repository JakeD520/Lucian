### **EXT. SERIM – QUIET HORIZON**

Endless light. Ocean breathing far below.  
Lucian stands at the railing — still as carved air.

Behind him: soft footfalls.

**EVANDER**  
You always end up out here when something’s tugging at you, First Light.

Lucian smiles without looking back.

**LUCIAN**  
Evander.  
Welcome, brother.

Evander joins him.  
A shared silence — familiar, earned.

**LUCIAN**  
Do you feel it?

Evander waits.

**LUCIAN** (cont’d)  
A… dissonance.  
With the humans.

Evander’s expression softens — unsurprised.

**EVANDER**  
The humans always have dissonance, brother.  
Noise, harmony, collapse, miracle.  
They adapt. They overcome.  
It’s their way.

Lucian shifts — a small, quiet disagreement.

**LUCIAN**  
Maybe.  
But this feels… different.  
(beat)  
There’s a thread in The Pattern that concerns me.

Evander considers him — choosing his response.

**EVANDER**  
Lucian…  
do you truly believe our Creator intended us to follow The Pattern like scripture?

Lucian turns, surprised by the bluntness.

**EVANDER** (cont’d)  
Perhaps He meant for us to enjoy what He gave us.  
Not spend eternity dissecting fate like scholars.

Lucian turns back to the horizon — doubt lingering like a shadow.

**LUCIAN**  
If the Pattern shifts, we should know why.

Evander exhales — affection mixing with pity.

**EVANDER**  
You are the only one who hears the Pattern that deeply.  
Maybe that’s the gift.  
(softer)  
Maybe that’s the burden.

Lucian’s jaw tightens — an acceptance, not defiance.

Evander leans casually on the railing.

**EVANDER**  
Come. Drift with me for a moment.  
Let the future arrive when it’s ready.

Lucian doesn’t move. He softens — barely.

Evander reaches into a small leather pouch.

**EVANDER**  
Speaking of drifting…  
I picked these up in Havana.  
Or Lisbon.  
One of the warm places with good soil.

He offers Lucian a cigar.

Lucian takes it, curious.  
Evander lights his own, then Lucian’s.

They smoke — ocean wind carrying the scent into sky.

**EVANDER**  
Here’s the thing, Lucian.  
I don’t give a shit how these are made.  
Or who’s fighting over them.  
It’s a _fucking good cigar._

Lucian exhales, smoke curling upward.

**LUCIAN**  
Humans…  
they’ve started giving their hearts to things that aren’t even things.  
Chasing the feeling instead of what gives the feeling.

Evander chuckles softly, entirely unbothered.

**EVANDER**  
Chasing shadows is their favorite game.

Lucian’s gaze stays distant.

**LUCIAN**  
This shadow feels loud.  
Like something they believe they’re holding,  
even when it isn’t there.

Evander taps ash over the cliff.

**EVANDER**  
Shadow, symbol, object — doesn’t matter.  
They make it all up as they go.  
Let them.

Lucian draws slow, contemplative.

**LUCIAN**  
When the illusion becomes the thing they trust…  
the Pattern bends around it.

Evander shrugs, inspecting the cigar wrapper.

**EVANDER**  
Patterns bend.  
You stare long enough, you’ll find earthquakes in the grain.

Lucian looks at him — not annoyed, just tired.

**LUCIAN**  
You say that as if watching isn’t part of who we are.

**EVANDER**  
Watching isn’t worrying, brother.  
You confuse the two.

Lucian says nothing — which says everything.

They smoke in silence.  
Two gods.  
Two wavelengths.

Evander finally nods at Lucian’s ember.

**EVANDER**  
Don’t stare at it like it’s an omen.  
It’s a cigar.  
Let the future arrive when it’s ready.

Lucian takes one last drag.

**LUCIAN**  
(quiet)  
That’s what I’m deciding.

They stand together, ocean breathing below.  
Smoke rising into a sky that suddenly feels less certain.

**FADE OUT.**
