INT. ARIS THORNE’S APARTMENT – NIGHT

Minimalist, elegant.  
Warm woods. Clean concrete. Soft glass reflections.

Floor-to-ceiling windows reveal the city below — a distant hum of life, headlights drifting like fireflies across a circuitry grid.

MUSIC: A faint wash of “Through Glass” plays on a nearby speaker. Just texture — low enough that you’d need to lean in to catch the melody.

Aris stands at the window, drink in hand.  
His posture is calm; his eyes aren’t.  
A man comfortable in silence, but not at peace.

His phone buzzes.

CALL INCOMING: Sara Keene.

He answers without hesitation.

ARIS  
Evening, stranger.

SARA (V.O.)  
You sound tired.

He smirks, drifting toward the kitchen.

ARIS  
You sound like someone eating dinner at her desk again.

SARA (V.O.)  
(mock scandalized)  
Excuse you — it was gourmet Chinese takeout.

He grabs a glass, fills it with water, shaking his head.

ARIS  
Living the dream, huh?

SARA (V.O.)  
Mmhmm. You?

He glances back at the window — the skyline glittering like a motherboard.

ARIS  
Just basking in the energy of the city before Skynet takes over.

SARA (V.O.)  
Don’t say that. Makes us sound ominous.

ARIS  
Maybe we are.

A small pause — comfortable, lived-in.

SARA (V.O.)  
Hey… look, I really think you should see some of these beta reviews.

ARIS  
Alright. Tomorrow? First thing?

A beat.

SARA (V.O.)  
Or…  
(soft)  
I mean, I’m just leaving the office.  
I could stop by.  
If that’s okay.

A smile catches him off-guard — soft, genuine.

ARIS  
You’re just using me for my wine selection.

SARA (V.O.)  
And your ridiculously big TV.  
Big Brother’s on tonight.

He laughs — the tension in his shoulders easing.

ARIS  
I’m in.

WIDE SHOT

Aris sets down his glass.  
He looks out once more — smiling.

The music fades.

FADE OUT.
