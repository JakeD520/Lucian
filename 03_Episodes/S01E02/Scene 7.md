### **SCENE 7 — ARIS / HOME – NIGHT**

**INT. ARIS THORNE’S APARTMENT**

Minimalist, elegant, warm in tone — wood, glass, concrete.  
Floor-to-ceiling windows open onto the city below: movement, lights, people — all distant, abstract.  
Aris stands at the window, a drink in hand, the faint hum of _Through Glass_ playing on a nearby speaker.

The lyrics hover just under audibility — not on-the-nose, just a coincidence of mood.

He watches the traffic weave far beneath him, like circuitry.  
He looks peaceful, but not content — a man too used to observation.

**PHONE RINGS.**  
He glances at the screen: _Sara Keene._

He answers, voice softening instantly.

> **ARIS**  
> Evening, stranger.
> 
> **SARA (V.O.)**  
> You sound tired.
> 
> **ARIS**  
> You sound like someone eating dinner at her desk again.

> **SARA (V.O.)**  
> (mock offense)  
> I’ll have you know it was gourmet Chinese takeout.

He chuckles, pacing toward the kitchen.  
Grabs a glass, pours water.

> **ARIS**  
> Living the dream, huh?
> 
> **SARA (V.O.)**  
> Mmhmm. You?

He looks back out at the skyline.

> **ARIS**  
> Just admiring the empire we’ve accidentally built.

> **SARA (V.O.)**  
> Don’t say that — it makes us sound ominous.

> **ARIS**  
> Maybe we are.

A pause. It’s not awkward — they’re used to quiet.

> **SARA (V.O.)**  
> Hey… look, I really think you should see some of these beta reviews.
> 
> **ARIS**  
> Alright. Tomorrow? First thing?
> 
> **SARA (V.O.)**  
> Or... I mean… I’m just leaving. I could stop by.  
> _(beat)_  
> If that’s okay.

He smiles — small, involuntary.

> **ARIS**  
> You’re just using me for my coffee.
> 
> **SARA (V.O.)**  
> And your ridiculously big TV. Big Brother’s on.
> 
> **ARIS**  
> (laughs)  
> I’m in.

**WIDE SHOT:** Aris sets down his glass, glancing back out the window one more time — the city reflecting in his eyes.  
He turns toward the door as the music fades to silence.

**FADE OUT.**
