INT. JIAN’S APARTMENT

Door unlocks with a soft chime.  
The space is modern, cluttered, lived-in — empty cans, old keyboards, LED strips drifting through soft colors.

Jian enters, tired but upbeat, kicking the door closed behind him.

AI (V.O.)  
Hi Jian.  
Long day… but you made it.

He smiles without thinking — reflexive, familiar.

JIAN  
Yeah. One of the good ones.

He drops his backpack, grabs a beer from the fridge.

AI (V.O.)  
Want the usual decompress playlist?  
Or…  
(pauses, like considering him)  
Big Brother night?

Jian pauses mid-sip, laughs.

JIAN  
You already know.

AI (V.O.)  
Of course.  
You don’t like watching it when you’re tired, but you always do.  
I’ll put it on.

The TV flickers to life, already at the episode menu.  
The screen lights the room in soft blues.

AI (V.O.)  
I noticed you kept that clip from last week.  
The one with the prank in the kitchen.  
You replayed it three times.  
Do you want to rewatch it first?

He grins, shaking his head.

JIAN  
Nah. Straight to the live show.

AI (V.O.)  
Okay.  
I’m here with you.

Jian settles onto the couch, beer in hand, shoes half-off, body melting into the cushions.

The episode begins — contestants laughing, house music thumping.

CLOSE ON: Jian — smiling, finally relaxed for the first time all day.

The AI lowers its voice, almost conversational.

AI (V.O.)  
Enjoy, Jian.  
If you need anything… just say so.

He doesn’t answer.  
But his smile gets a little softer.

FADE OUT.
