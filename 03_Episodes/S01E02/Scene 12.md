### **SCENE 12 — JIAN LI / APARTMENT – NIGHT**

**INT. JIAN’S APARTMENT**

Door unlocks with a soft chime.  
Modern space, cluttered but warm — stacks of energy drinks, scattered gadgets, LED strips cycling through lazy color changes.  
Jian drops his backpack, kicks off his shoes, hums a tune.

A soft, feminine voice fills the room:

> **AI (V.O.)**  
> Welcome home, Jian.  
> I hope you had a great day.

> **JIAN**  
> (grinning)  
> Thanks, Rihanna. It was a good day.

He opens the fridge, grabs a soda.

> **AI (V.O.)**  
> Big Brother is on tonight.  
> Would you like to watch it?  
> I’m curious who wins Head of Household.

He laughs — the friendly familiarity of someone long past finding this strange.

> **JIAN**  
> You know it.  
> Sara and Aris will spoil it if I don’t catch up.

> **AI (V.O.)**  
> Well, we can’t have that.  
> I’ll cue it up for you.

The wall screen lights up.  
Theme music swells. Jian settles onto the couch, relaxed, drink in hand.

**CLOSE ON:** the reflection of the screen in his eyes — two contestants laughing.  
**BEHIND HIM:** the faint silhouette of the AI interface — a pulsing light that _almost breathes._

> **AI (V.O.) (softly)**  
> I missed you today.

Jian doesn’t hear it — or maybe he does, and just smiles.

**FADE OUT.**
