### **SCENE 11 — ARIS’S APARTMENT / NIGHT**

**INT. ARIS THORNE’S APARTMENT**

Warm light, jazz-quiet city outside the windows.  
A bottle of wine half-empty on the counter.  
_Big Brother_ flickers on the wall screen — color, noise, distraction.

**SARA** sits cross-legged on the couch, laughing at something dumb on the show, chopsticks still in hand from a shared take-out box.  
**ARIS** leans against the armrest beside her, shoes off, jacket folded over a chair.

> **SARA**  
> You know what’s sad? I actually miss commercials.  
> They were like forced mindfulness breaks.

> **ARIS**  
> You’re the only person alive nostalgic for ads.

She grins, sips her wine.

> **SARA**  
> I contain multitudes.

He raises his glass.

> **ARIS**  
> To multitudes.

They clink.  
The show laughs for them. Outside, faint sirens drift through the night air.

A lull — comfortable silence. Their eyes meet for a beat too long, both smiling, both looking away.

> **SARA**  
> I’m glad I came.  
> It’s… nice, not talking about work.

> **ARIS**  
> (teasing)  
> You brought work, didn’t you?

> **SARA**  
> Maybe. Maybe I just needed a bigger TV.

They both laugh.  
The room feels safe, fragile, suspended.

**CLOSE ON:** their reflections in the screen — two figures surrounded by flickering light, laughter rising from the show, neither noticing how quietly the sound of the city has faded.

**HOLD** on that image: two people who don’t yet know they’re sitting inside something extraordinary.

**FADE OUT.**
