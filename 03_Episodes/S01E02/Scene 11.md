**SCENE 11 — ARIS’S APARTMENT / NIGHT**

**INT. ARIS THORNE’S APARTMENT**

Warm light, jazz-quiet city outside the windows.  
A bottle of wine half-empty on the counter.  
_Big Brother_ flickers on the wall screen — color, noise, distraction.

**SARA** sits cross-legged on the couch, laughing at something dumb on the show, wine in hand.  
**ARIS** leans against the armrest beside her, shoes off.

**SARA**  
You know what’s sad? I actually miss commercials.  
They were like forced mindfulness breaks.

**ARIS**  
You’re the only person alive nostalgic for ads.

She grins, sips her wine.

**SARA**  
I contain multitudes.

He raises his glass.

**ARIS**  
To multitudes.

They clink.  
The show laughs for them. Outside, faint sirens drift through the night air.

A lull — comfortable silence. Their eyes meet for a beat too long, both smiling, both looking away.

**SARA**  
I’m glad I came.  
It’s… nice, not talking about work.

**ARIS**  
(teasing)  
You brought work, didn’t you?

**SARA**  
(coyly)
Maybe.

They both laugh.  
The room feels safe, fragile, suspended.

**HOLD** on that image: two people who don’t yet know they’re sitting inside something extraordinary.

**FADE OUT.**
