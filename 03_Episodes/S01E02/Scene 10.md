### **SCENE 10 — LATE NIGHT / SYNAPSE DYNAMICS EXTERIOR**

**EXT. SYNAPSE DYNAMICS – CITY CENTER – NIGHT**

Glass tower. Corporate perfection lit from within — each floor a vein of light, humming, alive.  
Rain drizzles, soft and steady.

**LUCian** stands across the street, still beneath an umbrella he doesn’t need.  
He looks out of place yet completely at ease — like he’s been here before, like the city was built around him.

**WIDE SHOT:** reflections of moving traffic cross his face; his eyes stay fixed on the building.  
No expression of malice or awe — only recognition.

A gust of wind tugs at his coat.  
He tilts his head slightly, reading the glow in the upper windows like constellations.

> **LUCian (softly)**  
> So this is where they’ve hidden the new creation.

He steps closer to the curb; the building’s mirrored facade catches his image — distorted, multiplied, a thousand Lucians staring back.

> **LUCian (cont’d)**  
> (quiet, almost reverent)  
> They build it to feel, yet never ask what feeling costs.

A car passes, splashing water. He doesn’t flinch.  
Instead, he smiles — small, sad, inevitable.

**CUT TO – HIS POV:**  
high floors gleaming, boardroom silhouettes faint behind tinted glass.  
Somewhere up there: Aris, Sara, Devereaux. He doesn’t need to see them to _know._

> **LUCian (whisper)**  
> You’ve done well. Almost too well.

He lowers his gaze; the reflected lights ripple in the puddles at his feet —  
a mirror of Serim’s pools, distorted by rain.

> **LUCian (quietly)**  
> The chorus begins again.

He turns away from the tower, walking into the wet night, his figure fading into reflections —  
the camera holds on the building, bright and humming, its lights like a living organism.

**FADE OUT.**
