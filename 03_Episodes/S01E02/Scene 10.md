EXT. SYNAPSE DYNAMICS – CITY CENTER – NIGHT

The glass tower glows against the quiet city — a handful of floors lit like isolated constellations.  
Inside, silhouettes of late-night workers move through their routines: typing, pacing, gathering their things, staring at screens too long.

Lucian stands across the street, still.

He watches the building like a man reading signals in the sky — completely present, quietly focused.

WIDE SHOT

Traffic drifts by, spilling reflections across the tower’s surface.  
The lights behind the glass shift and overlap: a technician leaning back in his chair, someone wiping her face with both hands, another walking circles around a desk.

Lucian follows these small movements.  
There’s no judgment in his stare — only concern, and a kind of knowing that sits deep behind his eyes.

A breeze moves his coat.  
He steps closer to the curb.

A passing car throws a wave of light across the windows.  
For a moment, the workers inside look like figures cut into a diorama — unaware, absorbed, framed by the very architecture surrounding them.

Lucian studies one lit floor a beat longer — something in its glow pulling at him in a way he can’t translate.

His expression sharpens by a degree.  
A quiet recognition settles.

He drops his gaze, exhales once, steady.

Then he turns and walks into the night, disappearing between the lines of buildings.

The camera stays with Synapse Dynamics — its illuminated floors flickering with human activity, each window a tiny world behind glass.

FADE OUT.
