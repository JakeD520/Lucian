### **INT. SYNAPSE – ETHICS DIVISION – MORNING**

Bright, open office floor.  
Plants. Glass partitions.  
Sticky notes everywhere.

**SARA** walks in balancing a coffee and a half-eaten breakfast bar, still in her coat.

She barely makes it two steps before—

**JIAN LI** (28, hyper-caffeinated, hoodie with a cartoon squid, slight air of “didn’t sleep”) pops up behind her like a damn jack-in-the-box.

**JIAN**  
(low whisper right against her ear)  
Saaaaaaaara.

Sara flinches, nearly drops her coffee.

**SARA**  
Jesus, Jian—  
Do you _practice_ being a jump scare?

**JIAN**  
Every morning.  
Meditation, positive affirmations, sudden horror entrances.  
Keeps the nervous system nimble.

Sara stares at him.

He stares back, unblinking.

**SARA**  
Right…  
Well, please stop sharpening your nervous system on me.

**MARISOL RIVERA** (31, perfectly put-together blouse, deadpan assassin) strolls in holding an iced coffee bigger than her moral compass.

**MARISOL**  
(to Jian)  
I told you to stop sneaking up on people.  
It’s unethical.  
And creepy.  
Mostly creepy.

**JIAN**  
It’s _team building!_

**MARISOL**  
It’s therapy building.  
For other people.  
Because of you.

Sara bites back a laugh, heading to her desk.

Jian follows her like an excited golden retriever.

**JIAN**  
So. Sara.  
Important question:

Sara sighs.  
Takes a sip of coffee.  
Doesn’t slow him down.

**JIAN**  
On a scale from “Kelsey meltdown” to “Kelsey meltdown but with mascara,”  
where are you spiritually this morning?

Sara closes her eyes like she’s praying for patience.

**SARA**  
I swear to God, Jian…

**MARISOL**  
(faux whisper)  
He’s been like this since 7 AM.  
I think he’s too excited about the new patches for the model.

**JIAN**  
I _am_ excited!  
They fixed the empathy inversion loop!  
And the hallucinated scent bleeding!  
AND—  
(devil grin)  
—someone in testing said the model felt “spiritually aligned” with them.

Sara freezes.

Jian doesn’t notice.  
Marisol notices _everything._

**MARISOL**  
(firm, cutting him off)  
Jian.  
Maybe… don’t open with the phrase “spiritually aligned” before Sara’s finished her coffee.

**JIAN**  
What? It’s good!  
Spiritual alignment is good!  
Right?  
…Right?

Sara raises an eyebrow.

**SARA**  
We’ll… talk about it.  
Later.  
When I’m awake enough to not die.

Jian nods like she’s given him a gold star.

Marisol pulls a chair backward and sits in it like a delinquent detective.

**MARISOL**  
So.  
Did you finally catch up on Big Brother?

Sara groans into her hands.

**SARA**  
Yes.

**JIAN**  
(slaps desk)  
FINALLY!  
We can talk freely!  
Jian Li’s Cone of Silence™ is officially LIFTED—

Marisol throws a sticky note at him.  
It sticks to his forehead.

**JIAN**  
(eyes crossing to look at it)  
…rude.

Sara laughs — genuinely. The tension from last night softens.

**SARA**  
Okay, okay.  
Talk.  
What did I miss?

Jian and Marisol look at each other like children about to tell their mom absolute chaos.

**MARISOL**  
Sweetheart…  
you’re not ready.

**JIAN**  
You’re gonna scream.

**MARISOL**  
And possibly reevaluate your entire worldview.

**JIAN**  
AND your taste in people.

Sara can’t help but grin.

**SARA**  
Perfect.  
Let’s ruin my life before lunch.

They high-five over her head.

Sara rolls her eyes with affection.
