**EXT. CITY STREET – NIGHT**

A grocery bag on one arm, keys in her other hand, **SARA KEENE** walks home through a lively downtown block.  
Nothing dramatic — people talking at outdoor tables, a cyclist weaving through pedestrians, a bus hissing to a stop.

Sara adjusts the grocery bag — it’s heavier than she expected.  
She laughs at herself under her breath.

Ahead, a dog tied outside a café perks up at her.  
A shaggy mutt with big hopeful eyes.

Sara stops.

**SARA**  
Oh my god… you’re ridiculous.

She crouches, balancing the grocery bag awkwardly, and gives the dog a good scruff.  
The dog leans into it like they’re old friends.

**SARA**  
(to the dog)  
You are such a handsome boy.
Tell your human to hurry up.

She stands, brushing hair from her face.  
A stranger walking past smiles at her.

**STRANGER**  
He likes you.

**SARA**  
Well… I bribed him with compliments.  
Works on most men.

They share a small laugh, then part ways.

Sara continues down the sidewalk.

Near a closed storefront, **a homeless man** sits on the ground, back against the wall, bundled in layers that aren’t warm enough.  
He doesn’t speak.  
He just watches the street with tired eyes.

Sara slows as she passes.  
Stops.  
Turns back.

No moral debate.  
No pity.  
Just instinct.

She reaches into her grocery bag.  
Pulls out a container of berries — still sealed.  
She kneels and offers it.

**SARA**  
These okay?

The man nods, surprised but not performative.

**MAN**  
Yeah.  
Thank you.

**SARA**  
Take care tonight, okay?

He nods again — softer this time.

She stands, adjusting the bag on her arm, and continues walking.

For a moment, the world just… breathes.

Sara blends back into the flow of the street —  
a small act of grace already absorbed into the noise of the city.

### **CUT TO:**

Sara turning onto her block, city sounds fading behind her.
