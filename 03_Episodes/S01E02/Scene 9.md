### **SCENE 9 — SARA / ELEVATOR – NIGHT**

**INT. SYNAPSE DYNAMICS – ELEVATOR BANK**

The lobby is half-dark, late-shift cleaners moving like ghosts across polished floors.  
Sara steps into the elevator, tote bag over her shoulder, the weight of the day visible in the slump of her posture.  
She presses “Lobby.” The doors almost close—

A hand slips in: **JIAN LI**, late 20s, hoodie, code-stained backpack, earbuds around his neck.  
He’s cheerful in the way only engineers can be after twenty hours awake.

> **JIAN**  
> Whoa—saved it. Thanks.
> 
> **SARA**  
> Hey, Jian. Burning the midnight oil?
> 
> **JIAN**  
> Always. Deadline’s brutal, huh?  
> _(grins)_  
> But we’re mostly there. I think we’ll hit it.

> **SARA**  
> (measured)  
> That’s great. Aris and I are still tuning a few behavioral parameters. We’ll pass it along when it’s stable.

He nods, half-listening, already pulling up something on his phone.

> **JIAN**  
> Wait till you see the new model.  
> Speech latency’s down to near-zero; it anticipates mid-sentence pivots now.  
> It’s like… finishing your thought before you do.

> **SARA**  
> (tight smile)  
> Impressive.

> **JIAN**  
> Yeah! It’s wild—every user thinks the companion’s _in love_ with them.  
> _(laughs)_  
> Tech’s finally figured out affection, huh?

She forces a small laugh, looking away as the elevator hums.  
Her reflection in the mirrored wall is pale against his bright enthusiasm.

> **SARA**  
> Maybe.  
> Or maybe it’s just figured out _attention._

He doesn’t catch the tone.  
Doors slide open; he steps out, still talking.

> **JIAN**  
> Either way—it’s gonna change everything. Night, Dr. Keene!

She watches him disappear down the corridor.

The doors begin to close again.  
Sara exhales, alone now, eyes drifting to her phone—Aris’s missed call glowing on the screen.  
She lets it ring out this time.

**FADE OUT.**
