**EXT. CITY STREET – NIGHT**

A steady hum: traffic, chatter, phones buzzing, a bus braking, a car horn half a block away.

Into the flow steps **LUCIAN**.

Not glowing.  
Not cloaked in myth.  
Just a man in a long coat walking slowly down the sidewalk.

But he is **still**, the way mountains are still.  
The space around him seems to bend subtly —  
not visually, but emotionally.  
A calm in the noise.

People rush past him, heads down, screens up.

### **A WOMAN**

walking her dog, phone glowing inches from her face.

### **A TEENAGER**

laughing into earbuds at something on TikTok.

### **A COUPLE**

arguing without looking at each other, eyes on their notifications.

### **A DELIVERY BIKER**

glances at Lucian —  
then double-glances, startled for a split second  
but doesn’t understand why.  
He rides on.

Lucian passes a storefront window.

Inside: a row of exercise bikes in a late-night spin class,  
every rider staring at a wall-sized motivational screen.

Lucian pauses.  
Just watches.

No judgment.  
Only observation.

### CLOSE ON:

Lucian’s reflection in the glass —  
soft, steady —  
surrounded by a dozen humans sweating in unison,  
following a digital instructor.

The reflection feels out of place.  
He senses it too.

He turns away.

He walks past a bus stop —  
two strangers sitting side-by-side,  
each alone in their own world of blue light.

Lucian stops again — small, subtle.

He watches them a moment longer than comfort allows.

He lifts his gaze.

Across the street:  
A giant LED billboard blares an ad.

**“CONNECT DEEPER.”**  
**“FEEL SEEN.”**  
**“SYNAPSE: YOUR SHARED LANGUAGE.”**

A woman on the ad has her eyes closed, smiling peacefully, a fake intimacy glowing in high resolution.

Lucian’s jaw moves — infinitesimal.  
Not anger.  
Recognition.

A breeze passes through him.  
Urban noise fades slightly, like a low-pass filter dropped over the world for just a second.

Lucian’s focus shifts again —  
down the street, further:

A young man sits on a curb, face lit by his phone, tears quietly slipping down his cheek.

No camera crew.  
No livestream.  
No audience.

Just a human, breaking quietly.

Lucian watches him with the same expression he gave the ocean earlier:  
a sadness that is not reactive,  
but **cosmic**.

A long beat.

The young man wipes his face.  
Stands.  
Walks on.

Lucian closes his eyes.  
Just once.

He exhales.  
A slow, ancient breath.

Opens his eyes.

There’s a decision forming.  
Not made —  
but _forming._

He continues walking.

The city swallows him again.
