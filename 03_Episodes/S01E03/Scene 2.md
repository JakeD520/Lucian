# 🌙 **S01E03 — COLD OPEN**

_(Before the title card, before music fully rises.)_

## **INT. MAYA’S APARTMENT – NIGHT**

**CLOSE ON** Maya’s lips in the mirror.  
She’s applying lipstick with razor precision — then smudges it with her fingertip to make it look “effortless.”

Bathroom light = too bright.  
Hallway neon LED strip = too soft.  
Her friends are already laughing in the background.

Chloe (O.S.):

> “MAYAAA, let’s goooo! I’m thirsty!”

Maya checks herself one last time.

**CLOSE SHOT:**  
Her hand runs through her hair — too fast, too chaotic.  
She exhales.  
She smiles at herself.  
It’s the “tonight is ours” smile.

She grabs her phone.  
Full charge.  
Full bars.

She pockets it.

**Maya (to mirror):**

> “Okay… stay together this time.”

She kills the bathroom light.

**CUT TO BLACK — boom — we switch worlds.**

---

## **INT. KAI’S BEDROOM – SAME NIGHT**

**HARD CUT** to the glow of RGB LEDs.

Kai adjusts his headset in his monitor reflection — the same “mirror moment” as Maya’s, but digital.

He fixes a stray piece of hair with his palm.  
Not for vanity.  
For the camera.

He taps his mic.

**Discord connects — little bloop-bloop sounds.**  
Tiny face icons flash to life across his screen.

Saber_Knight:

> “Yoo! Kaiii! There he is!”

Jinx:

> “Let’s go, squad’s back tonight!”

Kai sits forward, excited.

Kai:

> “Okay — tonight? Nobody dips.  
> No random AFKs.  
> We’re actually staying together.”

They all cheer.

**His webcam preview flickers.**  
For half a second, Kai’s reflected face freezes — a tiny glitch, like foreshadowing.

He doesn’t notice.  
He puts his headphones on fully.

**CUT TO—**

---

## **INT. MAYA’S APARTMENT – NIGHT**

Maya opens the door.  
Chloe is waiting with three other friends, all chaotic energy.

Chloe (grabbing Maya’s wrist):

> “We stick together tonight, okay?  
> I’m serious.  
> LIKE.  
> Super serious.”

Everyone laughs — including Maya.

**Cue DRAMA – “Dark Rain” (slow fade-in).**

---

## **INTERCUT — MAYA AND KAI LEAVING THEIR WORLDS**

**MAYA’S GROUP:**  
Pouring out into the hallway, heels clacking, glitter everywhere, someone yelling “SHOTGUN FRONT SEAT!” before remembering they’re Ubering.

**KAI’S CREW:**  
All their icons lighting up on Discord.  
Someone’s cat walks across their keyboard.  
Someone else’s mic peaks.  
Someone is already eating chips too loudly.

Kai (smiling big):

> “Okay! Staying together.  
> No one vanish.”

**Maya:**

> “Okay! Staying together.  
> No one vanish.”

**Perfect overlay moment.**

One spoken IRL.  
One spoken digitally.  
Same line.  
Same rhythm.  
Same youthful hope.  
Different worlds.

## **EXT. MAYA’S STREET – NIGHT**

Door swings open — Bourbon Street lights already distant but calling.

**CLOSE on Maya’s face** as neon reflections hit her eyes.

She steps out into the heat, noise, and chaos of the city.

---

## **INT. KAI’S ROOM**

Kai pulls his rolling chair closer.  
Monitor glow washes him in soft blue.

**The first big bass hit of “Dark Rain” syncs with him clicking “Join Voice.”**

## **TITLE CARD: CRYSTAL GARDENS**

Episode 3: _Connection Drop_
# ⭐ **SCENE MODULE: KAI’S “BOSSFIGHT” — THE CALL FROM HIS MOM**

**INT. KAI’S COMPUTER SUITE – NIGHT**

Kai is deep in the glow.  
Laughing with his online friends.  
Screens alive.  
Music thumping.  
Everything rhythmic and alive.

Then—  
His phone buzzes.

**MOM** flashes on the screen.

The whole room seems to go quiet, even though nothing actually stops.  
Kai’s face slackens — not fear, not anger…  
more like a subtle dissociation, a shutting door behind his eyes.

He answers because he always answers.

**KAI**  
“Hey.”

**MOM (V.O. — sharp, clipped, immediate)**  
“You didn’t return my text. Again.”

Kai’s posture collapses inward.  
His voice gets smaller by a degree almost invisible unless you’re looking for it.

She launches into a barrage —  
criticism disguised as concern,  
concern disguised as control.

- Why didn’t he call earlier?
    
- Why hasn’t he visited?
    
- Why is he wasting time on games?
    
- Why can’t he be more like his cousin?
    
- Why isn’t he saving money?
    
- Why won’t he listen when she tells him what’s best?
    

None of it loud.  
None of it dramatic.  
Just constant.

Kai stares at the RGB reflection on his desk.  
His friends are talking in his headphones — muffled, distant, like another planet.

He murmurs standard responses:  
“Yeah.”  
“I know.”  
“I’ll try.”  
“Okay.”  
“Yes.”  
“No, that’s not what I— nevermind.”

He shrinks further.

Finally, she says something that hits too deep —  
something about responsibility, or shame, or “the way you were raised.”  
It doesn’t matter which — it lands.

Kai inhales.

**KAI**  
“I’m gonna go. I’ve got a thing. I’ll… call you later.”

A beat.  
A scoff from the other end.  
A click.

He lowers the phone.  
Doesn’t move for a long moment.

Then his monitor flickers —  
a friend yelling, laughing, pulling him back.

Kai slips on his headset again.  
He exhales.

**KAI**  
“Hey — sorry, guys. What’d I miss?”

The glow washes him back into the world where he feels whole.

**CUT.**

**EXT. BOURBON STREET – NIGHT**

Music spills out from a bar — brass, bass, people yelling in joy and half-drunken chaos.  
Inside, the packed dance floor is a moving organism — bodies compressed, lights flickering, sweat and neon everywhere.

**INT. BOURBON STREET BAR – CONTINUOUS**

MAYA, a little tipsy and glowing from the night, dances with **CHLOE** and **SAMIR**.  
It’s loose, stupid, joyful — hips swaying, hands in the air, laughing at nothing and everything.

They move as one unit, like a mini swarm in the larger chaos.

Then —

**Maya bumps someone.**

A solid chest.  
A moment of pressure.  
A hand reflexively steadies her elbow.

She turns.

**It’s MARCUS.**

He’s barely lit by the pulsing LED wash, but it hits him right:  
sharp jaw, soft eyes, the kind of face that looks like trouble in all the good ways.

Maya’s breath stutters — not dramatically, just enough that the camera catches her micro-freeze.

Marcus offers a small, crooked smile.  
Not cocky.  
Not cheesy.  
Just _aware._

Maya smiles back.  
Her whole expression softens, like she forgot she had muscles in her face until now.

They start moving together —  
not touching, not grinding,  
just _mirroring._  
Strong eye contact.  
Bodies swaying to the same beat.

The crowd blurs around them.

Maya doesn’t even blink.

Suddenly—

**CHLOE (O.S.)**  
(shouting over music)  
“I’m gonna get another drink! You want anything?”

Chloe is right at Maya’s shoulder, but Maya barely registers her.  
Her eyes stay locked on Marcus — a kind of gravity pulling her forward.

**MAYA**  
(still staring at Marcus)  
“Um… I… I’m good.”

Marcus laughs quietly — a warm, genuine laugh — like he can’t believe how cute this is.

Maya mirrors it.  
They’re locked in a tiny private universe while the bar crashes around them.

In the background:

Chloe walks away —  
but halfway to the bar, she turns, looks back.

Her face shifts.  
A tiny flicker of realization:

**Oh.  
We lost her.**

She continues on, disappearing into the crowd.

Back on Maya & Marcus:

He leans in slightly, finally about to speak —  
some opening line, silly or smooth or mundane, doesn’t matter.

Maya feels the pull.  
She wants to stay.  
Her body leans before her mind does.

Then —

She catches herself.

A breath.  
A blink.  
A flicker of loyalty.

**MAYA**  
(soft, almost regretful)  
“Hey… um… it was really nice meeting you, but…  
I think I _do_ need to get that drink.”

Marcus nods, surprised but respectful.  
A small smile — the “I get it” kind.

She steps back, almost stumbling as the crowd swallows her.

Maya slips through the bodies, finds Chloe by the bar, throws her arms around her from behind with a ridiculous laugh —  
CHLOE jumps, then laughs too.  
SAMIR appears with some insane neon drink, hyped as always.

The trio reconnect.  
Loud, messy, alive.

In the distance,  
Marcus watches Maya.  
Not pining — just…  
curious.  
Amused.  
Noticing.

Then he fades back into the crowd.

**CUT.**

# ⭐ **SCENE MODULE — CHLOË INSTIGATES / MAYA TAKES THE CHANCE**

_(Energetic, funny, warm, empowering — not exploitative, not peer-pressure-y)_

**EXT. BOURBON STREET – NIGHT**

The street is a riot of lights and noise — brass bands, neon signs, people yelling from balconies.  
A group of drunk guys above shout down, holding strings of beads like trophies.

**GUY ON BALCONY**  
“Who wants beads?! Show us somethin’!”

Chloë’s eyes light up.  
Maya laughs nervously — she already knows where this is going.

Chloë sashays forward like she owns the entire French Quarter.  
She flips her shirt up with zero hesitation, flashing the balcony crew.

The guys erupt — cheering, howling.  
Beads rain down in a glittering arc.

Chloë catches them like a pro, does a tiny victorious shimmy.

She turns to Maya, eyes sparkling.

**CHLOË**  
“Your turn!”

**MAYA**  
(laughing, mortified)  
“No. No way. Absolutely not.”

The guys spot Maya and start chanting her name, completely mispronouncing it.  
More beads dangle.  
More noise.

Chloë drapes her beads around Maya’s neck —  
leaning in close enough that Maya can smell the sugar from her hurricane cocktail.

**CHLOË**  
(soft, teasing, not pushy)  
“Come on. No one here knows you.  
You’ll never see ’em again.  
Just be… reckless. For ten seconds.”

Maya stands there, frozen.  
She looks up at the balcony — the noise, the laughter, the stupid exuberant joy.  
She looks back at Chloë — fearless, bright, alive in a way Maya sometimes _wishes_ she could be.

Maya’s breath catches.

This isn’t peer pressure.  
This is admiration.  
Inspiration.  
Permission.

She turns away, thinking —  
then turns back with a tiny, nervous smile.

**MAYA**  
“Okay… screw it.”

Chloë claps, startled but delighted.

Maya steps forward.  
Her hands shake a little.  
She looks up again — the balcony crew chanting, beads swaying, a stupid, chaotic moment that suddenly feels… safe.

She exhales —  
lifts her shirt —  
JUST enough —  
quick, shy, barely a flash —  
and the balcony explodes with cheers.

Beads rain down like a shower of neon.

Maya laughs — a real laugh, deeper than her earlier ones.

Chloë grabs her arm, pulling her back into the throng.

**CHLOË**  
“See?! That’s what I’m talking about!”

**MAYA**  
(blushing, giddy)  
“Oh my god, that was— I can’t believe—”

**SAMIR** (appearing out of nowhere)  
“You two are CHAOS.”

They all burst out laughing.

For a moment — Maya isn’t the antiques girl.  
Not the old soul.  
Not the reserved one.  
She’s just a young woman choosing to live.

**CUT.**

# ⭐ **SCENE MODULE — QUEER GROUP + EVANGELIST

(Nuanced, human, real, not caricatured)**

**EXT. BOURBON STREET – NIGHT**

The trio turns a corner into a knot of louder sound — not dangerous, just tense.

A **street evangelist** stands with a small wooden cross, voice steady, forceful, but not hateful:

**EVANGELIST**  
“Brothers, sisters—  
you don’t have to lose yourselves to be loved.  
There is love bigger than any of this—”

His tone is conviction, not condemnation.

Nearby, a group of **queer friends** — a mix of identities, energies, outfits — notice him.  
They’re not drunk.  
Not caricatures.  
Just _people_, out celebrating a night that means something to them.

One of them, **a tall femme-presenting person in glitter boots**, crosses their arms.

**GLITTER BOOTS**  
(loudly, but not screaming)  
“Hey—  
some of us fought damn hard to be ourselves out here.”

The evangelist pauses.  
Not to challenge —  
but because the comment actually lands.

**EVANGELIST**  
“I’m not saying you shouldn’t be yourselves.”

**SHORT-HAIRED WOMAN**  
“But you’re saying we need saving.”

A murmur among the group.  
Not mob hostility —  
just simmering hurt.

**EVANGELIST**  
(with sincerity, not attack)  
“We all need saving.  
Me too.”

That takes the edge out of the air — not fully, but enough.

The queer group exchanges looks.  
They weren’t expecting vulnerability.

One guy — **a soft-spoken person with a rainbow bandana** — steps forward slightly.

**RAINBOW BANDANA**  
“Man…  
you don’t know what people like us hear every day.”

The evangelist’s expression shifts —  
compassion, but also his own pain.

**EVANGELIST**  
“And you don’t know what’s been carried in my heart either.”

The tension eases by a degree.  
Not resolved — just… understood.

Maya, Chloë, and Samir observe from a few steps back, not intruding.

**MAYA**  
(softly, thoughtful)  
“It’s like they’re speaking two truths…  
and they can’t hear each other through the volume.”

**CHLOË**  
“Different wounds.  
Same street.”

**SAMIR**  
“Everyone trying not to disappear.”

The queer group eventually drifts on —  
not defeated, not triumphant.  
Just choosing to disengage.

As they leave, the rainbow bandana person turns back and lifts a hand —  
an indirect peace gesture.

The evangelist nods back.  
A small, tired acknowledgment.

Two groups  
with two histories  
passing like ships in a loud, complicated night.

The trio walks on, quieter now.

**CUT.**

# ⭐ **SCENE MODULE — MAYA’S BUSINESS CARD GIFT (PERFECT VERSION)**

_(Cinematic, intimate, grounded, real-world dangerous but beautiful)_

**EXT. BOURBON STREET – NIGHT**

The night has thinned — the crowd still buzzing, but looser now, stragglers drifting between bars.  
Music fades in and out as doors open and close.

A **busker** sits on the curb near a shuttered doorway.  
Guitar in his lap.  
Head down.  
Not performing — just existing.  
The kind of stillness that makes the chaos around him feel louder.

Maya notices him first.  
Not because he looks pitiful or dangerous —  
but because something in his posture feels… honest.

She slows.  
Chloë, ever protective, instinctively reaches for her elbow.  
Maya gently pulls free.

She steps toward him.

**MAYA**  
“Hey… you doing okay?”

The busker looks up.  
Eyes tired, but present.  
Older than he should be.  
He studies her face, unsure why she stopped.

**BUSKER**  
“Just trying to stay warm.  
Trying to stay… in the world.”

Maya nods, something soft opening in her chest.

She reaches into her small crossbody purse —  
not for money, not for a trinket —  
and pulls out a simple **business card**:

**“Lefevre Antiques  
Est. 1954  
French Quarter  
Ask for Maya or Grandma Rosa”**

It’s a real piece of her life.  
A private doorway.

She holds it out.

The busker hesitates — then takes it carefully, like it might break.

**MAYA**  
“We open at ten most days.  
If you come by…  
I can get you some blankets.  
Or coffee.  
Or just… somewhere warm to sit for a minute.”

The busker's face cracks — not into a smile, but into something deeper:

**recognition.**

Someone saw him.  
Someone cared enough to offer a place, not just pity.

**BUSKER**  
“You’d do that?  
For me?”

**MAYA**  
(soft, earnest)  
“For anyone who needed it.”

The busker swallows — overwhelmed in a quiet, human way.

He tucks the card into his jacket like it’s valuable.

**BUSKER**  
“You have a good heart.  
Hope it stays that way.”

Chloë calls gently from a distance:

**CHLOË**  
“Maya…? Everything okay?”

Maya nods without looking back.

**MAYA**  
“Yeah.  
Just…  
talking.”

She stands, gives the man a last warm glance, and joins her friends.  
They walk off into the glowing chaos.

The busker watches her go.  
Then looks down at the business card again,  
softly touching the embossed lettering like it’s a lifeline.

**CUT.**

# ⭐ **BUCKET KID — FLOURISHED VERSION**

**EXT. BOURBON STREET – NIGHT**

The crowd opens just enough for a pocket of space —  
glow from a neon beer sign strobes across the pavement.

A kid sits on an upside-down bucket,  
feet planted wide,  
drumming on another bucket between his knees.  
A third bucket sits out front with a few bills softening in the humidity.

His sticks click and slap in a looping pattern that cuts through the street noise.

Maya stops mid-stride.  
Her hips fall into the beat like gravity found her.

Chloë steps beside her, matching the sway,  
fingertips flicking little syncopated shapes in the air.  
Samir melts in last, shoulder pops and goofy shuffles.

The three of them form a tiny, accidental circle around the kid —  
no audience, no performance, just  
**their bodies catching a rhythm because it’s there.**

The kid looks up for half a heartbeat —  
not breaking rhythm —  
then drops back into his buckets.

The trio rides the beat for a few seconds more,  
laughing under their breath,  
then drift forward again,  
still carrying the rhythm in their steps.

Behind them, the kid keeps drumming,  
same tempo, same buckets,  
folded seamlessly back into the night.

**CUT.**

# ⭐ **SCENE MODULE — “WHERE YOU GOT THEM” HUSTLE**

_(Energetic, joyful, mischievous, communal.)_

**EXT. BOURBON STREET – NIGHT**

The trio drifts behind a group of tourists — big daiquiris in hand, gawking upward at balconies.

A sharp-dressed street hustler slides up beside one of the guys.

**HUSTLER**  
“Hey man, nice shoes.  
Bet you five dollars I can tell you where you got ’em.”

The tourist grins, already suspicious but amused.

**TOURIST**  
“Oh yeah? Try me.”

The hustler squares up, milking the moment, building anticipation.

Maya, Chloë, and Samir watch from a few steps away — smiling like they’re seeing an old friend tell a beloved joke.

The hustler leans in, dramatic as hell.

**HUSTLER**  
“You got them…”

He lifts his hands like a magician about to reveal a rabbit.

Maya can’t help herself —  
she blurts with a huge grin:

**MAYA**  
“ON BOURBON STREET!”

Chloë and Samir jump right in, shouting with her:

**CHLOË & SAMIR**  
“ON BOURBON STREET!”

A small crowd turns to look.

The tourist bursts out laughing, the joke landing _because_ the trio boosted it.

The hustler throws his arms up like he’s onstage at the Saenger.

**HUSTLER**  
“THAT’S RIGHT, BABY!  
ON!  
BOURBON!  
STREET!”

He does a quick victory shuffle —  
and Maya, Chloë, Samir join him in a little celebratory dance circle.

The tourist, caught up in the moment, does a clumsy shimmy to join in.

Everyone’s laughing —  
nobody feels conned,  
everybody feels _included_.

The tourist pulls a crumpled five from his pocket and hands it over with a salute.

**TOURIST**  
“Worth every penny.”

The hustler pockets the bill smoothly.

**HUSTLER**  
“See? City loves you. Treat her right.”

He high-fives Maya as he floats off into the night toward his next mark.

The trio keeps walking, sharing a little bounce from the leftover rhythm.

Samir gestures after the hustler.

**SAMIR**  
“I swear, that guy is undefeated.”

**CHLOË**  
“He’s a local treasure.”

**MAYA**  
“He’s the mayor, actually.”

They laugh, disappearing back into the neon river.

**CUT.**

# ⭐ **SCENE MODULE — MAYA LOSES THE GROUP (DISCONNECTION MOMENT)**

**EXT. BOURBON STREET – NIGHT**

Maya is mid-laugh — head tipped back, cheeks flushed from the last burst of dancing.

She turns to share the moment with her friends—

But the space beside her is empty.

Her smile falters.

She turns left.  
Right.  
Nothing.

Just **a shifting wall of strangers** spilling through the street — beads, neon drinks, feathers, camera flashes.  
The music from each bar blends into a blurred roar.

The camera circles Maya slowly —  
faces passing, lights streaking, the noise pressing in.

She stands still for a moment, breathing through it, eyes scanning above the crowd.

No panic.  
Just a sudden smallness.

She starts walking — slow, steady — weaving between bodies, eyes searching.

Then—

A **burst of music** from a nearby doorway.

Samir appears in the pocket of light spilling onto the street —  
dancing with huge, exaggerated moves,  
hands over his head,  
hips doing something only Samir would call dancing.

A few feet away, Chloë stands with her drink,  
eyes closed,  
swaying gently to the beat,  
completely in her own world.

Maya stops.  
Relief softens her shoulders.  
Her smile returns — smaller at first, then full.

She dance-walks toward them, slipping back into the rhythm like a tide returning to shore.

Samir sees her and yells something joyful.  
Chloë opens one eye, grins, and lifts her drink in greeting.

Maya slides in between them, caught by the music again.

**CUT.**

# ⭐ **SCENELET 1 — The Sidestep**

**EXT. BOURBON STREET – NIGHT**

A group of tourists freezes suddenly in front of the trio, arms raised for a group selfie.

Without thinking, Maya and Chloë **mirror each other** — a clean sidestep to opposite sides of the walkway, like synchronized dancers avoiding a puddle.

Samir slides between them with a goofy flourish, eyebrows up like “nailed it.”

They never stop walking or talking.

**CUT.**

---

# ⭐ **SCENELET 2 — The Spin-Out**

**EXT. BOURBON STREET – LATER**

A couple blocks down, a bachelorette party blocks half the street.  
One bridesmaid swings a phone around wildly, trying to get everyone in the shot.

As the phone swivels toward them—

Chloë grabs Maya’s hands and **spins her** in a quick half-turn, both of them twirling out of frame like it was planned.

Samir ducks under the phone arm at the last second, laughing as he pops back up behind them.

**CUT.**

---

# ⭐ **SCENELET 3 — The Head-Drop**

**EXT. NEAR A BAR DOORWAY**

A loud _flash_ erupts as a drunk guy takes a selfie with his friends near a neon sign.

Maya sees it coming and simply **drops her head**, letting the crowd swallow the shot above her.

Chloë smirks: she follows suit, shoulder to shoulder.

Samir walks through behind them with both hands raised like a referee calling a touchdown.

They keep moving, still in rhythm with the music bleeding out of the bar.

**CUT.**

---

# ⭐ **SCENELET 4 — The Shoulder Roll**

**EXT. BOURBON STREET – CONTINUOUS**

A trio of college kids cluster for a wide-angle selfie, phones held high and low at every angle.

Maya instinctively drifts left.  
Chloë drifts right.  
Samir **rolls his shoulders** and slips between all three phones like he’s threading a needle.

The whole thing lasts two seconds.

Nobody acknowledges it.

They regroup instantly, laughing about something else entirely.

**CUT.**

---

# ⭐ **SCENELET 5 — The Reverse-Step**

**EXT. STREET CORNER – LATER**

A tourist steps into the walkway unexpectedly, arm outstretched with a selfie stick.  
The trio reacts almost as one organism:

- Maya **steps back**
    
- Chloë **steps sideways**
    
- Samir **pulls a tiny U-turn** behind them
    

They reconverge two beats later, still in motion, still connected, the phone never part of the conversation.

**CUT.**

# ⭐ **SCENE MODULE — MAYA’S MOTHER, THE FORTUNE TELLER**

**EXT. BOURBON STREET SIDE ALCOVE – NIGHT**

The noise thins just enough for a different texture to settle in —  
candles flickering in colored glass jars,  
incense curling in slow ribbons,  
a small folding table draped in deep plum fabric.

Behind it sits **MAYA’S MOM**, mid-50s, warm-eyed, silver streaks in her braids,  
a stack of tarot cards in her hands.  
She looks more like a favorite aunt than a mystic —  
comfortable, grounded, unmistakably local.

A tourist couple stands, thanking her softly, tucking her business card into a purse.

As they leave, Maya spots her.

Her whole face lights up.

She rushes forward.

**MAYA**  
“Mama!”

Her mother stands to meet her —  
and they fold into a hug that looks like muscle memory.

Chloë and Samir are right behind, grinning.

**CHLOË**  
“Hey, mama LeFevre!”

**SAMIR**  
“Looking radiant, as always.”

Maya’s mom pulls them both into side hugs, kissing each of their cheeks.

**MAYA’S MOM**  
“Oh my babies are out causing trouble tonight, I see.”

**CHLOË**  
“Only the fun kind.”

**SAMIR**  
“Only the sometimes legal kind.”

Maya rolls her eyes, but she’s glowing — this is comfort, this is home.

Her mom cups Maya’s face gently between her palms for a second.

**MAYA’S MOM**  
“You look happy.”

Maya shrugs with a tiny smile she tries to hide.

**MAYA**  
“I’m good.  
We’re just wandering.”

Her mom taps her tarot deck lightly, as if to say _‘I see more than you’re saying’_ —  
but she never opens the door to prophecy.

She’s not here to foreshadow.  
She’s here to **love**.

**MAYA’S MOM**  
“Wander safe.  
The Quarter is loud tonight.”

Samir leans in conspiratorially.

**SAMIR**  
“I think it’s louder because we’re in it.”

Maya’s mom laughs — that deep, warm kind that fills everything around her.

She squeezes Maya’s hand.

**MAYA’S MOM**  
“Come by the shop tomorrow.  
Your grandmother wants to show you something she found in storage.”

Maya nods — this feels like a thread to her real life, her ancestry.

Chloë kisses Maya’s mom on the cheek before they go.

**CHLOË**  
“We’ll bring her home in one piece.”

Her mom waves them off.

**MAYA’S MOM**  
“Just bring her home.”

The trio slips back into the street,  
the noise swelling again as the quiet pocket closes behind them.

**CUT.**

## ⭐ **1. The Passing Groove**

A stranger passes Maya, shoulder brushing hers, both of them accidentally falling into the same beat for two steps before drifting apart again.

CUT.

---

## ⭐ **2. The Doorway Bass Drop**

As they walk past an open bar door, a heavy bass hit blasts out —  
Samir jumps into a half-two-step,  
Chloë does one sharp shoulder roll,  
Maya gives a tiny hip snap.

The door swings shut.  
Silence again.

CUT.

## ⭐ **3. The Balcony Bounce**

Someone on a balcony above dances wildly —  
their silhouette jerky and joyful —  
Maya instinctively mirrors it for half a second.

CUT.

## ⭐ **4. The Street Circle**

A group of strangers forms a loose dance circle around a bluetooth speaker on the sidewalk.  
Chloë slips into the edge of it,  
Samir joins with one goofy move,  
Maya claps on beat, laughing.

CUT.

## ⭐ **1. The Full-Body Fortnite Victory Dance**

Kai shoots out of his chair,  
steps into open space,

A spin, a kick, a hip pop.  
He laughs at himself mid-move.

**CUT.**

---

## ⭐ **2. The “Lighting Strip Rave”**

Kai kills the overhead light.

We hear nothing — but his body is in a full groove.

**CUT.**

(When you _want_ to intercut clearly between them)**

# ⭐ **KAI CREW SCENE — “THE MATCH” (DIALOGUE-HEAVY VERSION)**

_(250–350 words)_

**INT. KAI’S APARTMENT – NIGHT**

Kai leans forward in his chair, fingers flying, eyes glued to the unseen screen.

**KAI**  
“Ohhhh my god— SKATTER, WHERE ARE YOU?!”

**INT. SKATTERBRAIN’S ROOM – SAME**

SkatterBrain is half out of his chair, body angled sideways like he’s dodging something.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
(screaming)  
“I’M RIGHT HERE, I’M RIGHT HERE— DON’T YELL AT ME— I’M CONTRIBUTING!”

He absolutely is not contributing.

**INT. KITTYKAT24’S ROOM – SAME**

Kitty is centered in her chair, calm as a monk, sipping from a mug.

**KITTY**  
“You two are chaos gremlins. Watch and learn.”

She suddenly gasps.

**KITTY**  
“Oh— OH! OH LET’S GO— did you SEE that?!”

**KAI (V.O.)**  
“Ohhh Kitty popped OFF— SKATTER, DID YOU SEE HER?!”

**SKATTERBRAIN (V.O.)**  
“I SAW IT, I SAW IT, I SAW ALL OF IT— Kitty out here doing GOD’S WORK—”

Suddenly:

**KAI**  
(screaming)  
“HE’S BEHIND YOU, HE’S BEHIND YOU— SKATTER, TURN AROUND— TURN AROUND!”

SkatterBrain spins so hard in his chair he nearly falls out of frame.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“DON’T TELL ME TO TURN AROUND— TELL ME WHY YOU LET HIM GET BEHIND ME!!”

**KITTY (V.O.)**  
(laughing uncontrollably)  
“You two are so dramatic— Kai breathe— SKATTER breathe— EVERYBODY BREATHE—”

Kai slams both hands on the desk in triumph.

**KAI**  
“YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS— EASY CLAP— SOMEBODY CLIP THAT— CLIP IT—”

Kitty screams laughing.

**KITTY**  
“Who’s clipping it?! Nobody’s clipping it— we’re literally not even streaming!”

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“Shut up— shut up— let him have this— LET HIM HAVE HIS MOMENT—”

Kai jumps out of his chair and launches into a victory dance.

**KAI**  
“GET REKT— SIT DOWN— UNINSTALL— DELETE THE GAME— DELETE YOUR LIFE—”

**KITTY**  
(cry-laughing)  
“Kai, Kai— babe— breathe. You’re too into it.”

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“No no no don’t breathe— this is his final form— let him COOK—”

Kitty suddenly stops laughing and whispers:

**KITTY**  
“Oh shit… guys?  
Guys he’s still alive.”

A beat— all three freeze.

Then they ALL scream.

**KAI**  
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO—”

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“ABORT— ABORT— SAVE ME—”

**KITTY**  
“I TOLD YOU— I TOLD YOU— Y’ALL DON’T LISTEN—”

They dissolve into overlapping chaos, laughter, and shrieking.

Three rooms, one rhythm.

**CUT.**

# ⭐ **KAI CREW SCENE — “THE CONSPIRACY THREAD”**

_(300+ words, heavy dialogue, pure Saturday-night energy)_

**INT. KITTYKAT24’S ROOM – NIGHT**

Kitty is leaned ALL the way back in her chair, phone held above her face, squinting hard.

**KITTY**  
“This is the dumbest thing I’ve ever read. I swear. My brain is melting.”

She scrolls aggressively (we don’t see the screen), eyebrows climbing her forehead.

**KITTY**  
(reading)  
“Oh my god— ‘the pigeons are government agents.’  
Stop. Absolutely stop.”

**INT. SKATTERBRAIN’S ROOM – SAME**

SkatterBrain is hunched over his desk, hands covering half his face like he’s bracing for impact.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“No, no, no— go back— what ABOUT the pigeons?”

**KITTY (V.O.)**  
“They’re spies, apparently. Like… biomechanical drones. That poop.”

SkatterBrain wheezes, falls sideways in his chair.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“WHY would a spy DRONE poop?!”

**INT. KAI’S APARTMENT – SAME**

Kai has both hands pressed to his forehead, staring at the unseen screen like he’s witnessing a national tragedy.

**KAI**  
“Kitty. Kitty. Please scroll slower. My soul can’t handle your reading speed.”

Kitty gasps sharply.

**KITTY**  
“Oh God. Oh God it gets worse.  
It says— hang on, I have to say this in full dramatic monologue—”

She sits up straight, eyes wide.

**KITTY**  
(delivering like Shakespeare)  
‘The pigeons are recharging using THE SUN.’”

A beat.

Then Kai SNORTS.

SkatterBrain SCREAM-laughs.

**KAI**  
“No. Absolutely not. I refuse. I reject the lore.”

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
(stop-motion gasping)  
“They’re SOLAR POWERED— GOVERNMENT PIGEONS— BRO I CAN’T—”

Kitty keeps scrolling, horrified.

**KITTY**  
“There’s diagrams. There are— there are IMAGES. I’m going to puke.”

Kai leans in like he’s about to witness a crime scene.

**KAI**  
“How detailed are these diagrams?”

**KITTY**  
“Like way too detailed. Like… you could build your OWN government pigeon.”

**SKATTERBRAIN (V.O.)**  
“Oh perfect. DIY espionage. Pinterest but unhinged.”

Kitty suddenly stops scrolling, staring in abject disbelief.

**KITTY**  
“Guys.  
GUYS.  
They have step-by-step instructions.”

Kai slides back in his chair like he’s been hit.

**KAI**  
“Oh my god. We’re gonna get put on a list.”

SkatterBrain throws both hands in the air.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“This is how I go to prison.  
Because Kitty read me PIGEON FANFICTION.”

Kitty wipes tears from her eyes, laughing.

**KITTY**  
“I didn’t write it! I’m the victim!”

Kai suddenly goes quiet.  
Leans in.  
Whispers:

**KAI**  
“…What if it’s right, though?”

Kitty screams.  
SkatterBrain screams.  
All three dissolve into absolute chaos.

**CUT.**

# ⭐ **KAI CREW SCENE — “ONLYFEET”**

_(300+ words, full dialogue, lived-in friendship vibe)_

**INT. KITTYKAT24’S ROOM – NIGHT**

Kitty is sprawled on her bed, one knee up, painting her toenails with practiced precision.  
Laptop glow washes half her face; the other half flickers with pink LED light.  
Her headset sits crooked on her head — one ear on, one ear off.

She wiggles her toes proudly.

**KITTY**  
“Okay, honest question…  
you think I could do foot porn?”

**INT. KAI’S APARTMENT – SAME**

Kai jerks upright in his chair like he just heard a war crime.

**KAI**  
“WHAT— Kitty, what the— NO.  
Absolutely not.  
You’re better than that. Jesus.”

**KITTY (V.O.)**  
(laughing)  
“Relax. It’s a market. A _big_ market.”

**INT. SKATTERBRAIN’S ROOM – SAME**

SkatterBrain is mid-sip of soda.  
He chokes, sputters, wipes his face.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“Girl, no. NO. You can’t. You can’t do that.  
Actually… I mean… your feet _are_ kinda cute—”

**KITTY (V.O.)**  
“SEE?! Validation!”

Kai slaps his own forehead.

**KAI**  
“Oh my god.  
No, Kitty. No.  
You’re gonna get weird uncles named ‘ToeLover92’ in your DMs.”

Kitty lifts her foot toward the unseen webcam.

**KITTY**  
“Whatever. I have good arches. This is God’s work.”

SkatterBrain leans all the way back in his chair, groaning dramatically.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“She’s not Kai.  
Have you seen her Fortnite stats?  
Feet might be her only calling.”

**KITTY**  
“How _dare_ you—”

**KAI (V.O.)**  
“He’s not wrong, though.”

**KITTY**  
(sharply)  
“EXCUSE me— _I_ carried us last round.”

Kai raises an eyebrow slowly.

**KAI**  
“You died in the tutorial zone.”

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“And blamed lag.”

**KITTY**  
“I _WAS_ lagging!”

Kai points a finger at the unseen screen like he’s lecturing her.

**KAI**  
“Kitty. My friend. My dude.  
‘Lag’ doesn’t explain walking off a roof.”

Kitty gasps dramatically, clutching her chest.

**KITTY**  
“Are you saying I’m bad at the game?”

SkatterBrain jumps in instantly.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“No, no— he’s saying you’re PERFECT for OnlyFeet.  
Embrace your destiny.”

**KITTY**  
“You’re both trash.”

Kai smirks.

**KAI**  
“And you’re one $5 Venmo from a midlife crisis.”

Kitty kicks her foot toward the webcam like she’s about to stomp them through the internet.

**KITTY**  
“BLOCKED.”

They all dissolve into overlapping laughter —  
genuine, stupid, late-night laughter.

**CUT.**

# ⭐ **KAI CREW SCENE — “CONNECTION LOST”**

_(Full scene, intercut-friendly, no monitors shown)_

**INT. KAI’S APARTMENT – NIGHT**

Kai is mid-sentence — animated, ranting about God-knows-what — when he suddenly freezes.

His face goes flat.

He taps his headphones.

**KAI**  
“…hello?”

He looks left.  
Looks right.  
Taps the side of his PC tower like he’s knocking on a neighbor’s door.

Silence.

A little LED on his desktop flickers.  
Then dies.

Kai’s eyes go wide.

**KAI**  
“Oh, come ON— not now— NOT— NOW—”

He flies out of his chair, full panic, pacing in a tight line.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. KITTYKAT24’S ROOM – SAME**

Kitty squints at her unseen screen, then makes a sad, theatrical pout.

**KITTY**  
“Oh no…  
We lost Kai.”

She sighs dramatically, flopping back on her bed like she’s fainting.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. SKATTERBRAIN’S ROOM – SAME**

SkatterBrain leans WAY into his webcam, whispering like it’s a memorial service.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“He lived stupidly.  
He died stupidly.  
He will be remembered— briefly.”

Kitty snorts off-screen.

**KITTY (V.O.)**  
“Guess we’re on our own now.”

**CUT BACK TO:**

**INT. KAI’S APARTMENT – SAME**

Kai is rebooting EVERYTHING:

- slams the power button
    
- flips his router like a pancake
    
- whispers threats at his equipment
    

**KAI**  
(snarling)  
“Work. Work. WORK.  
You useless beige TIME CAPSULE—”

He stops.  
Thinks.  
Eyes widen.

He grabs his phone like it’s Excalibur.

**KAI**  
“THANK YOU GOD FOR CREATING HOTSPOTS ON THE EIGHTH DAY.”

He taps, swipes, taps again — frantic, breathless.

A green indicator light on his PC flares back to life.

Kai gasps.

Throws himself into his chair.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. SKATTERBRAIN’S ROOM – SAME**

SkatterBrain jolts upright.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“KAI!!  
HE LIVES!”

**INT. KITTYKAT24’S ROOM – SAME**

Kitty claps her hands in delight.

**KITTY**  
“WELCOME BACK TO EXISTENCE!”

**CUT TO:**

**INT. KAI’S ROOM – SAME**

Kai holds his arms out like a resurrected messiah.

**KAI**  
“My children…  
I have returned.”

All three collapse into chaotic, overlapping laughter.

**CUT.**

# ⭐ **KAI CREW SCENE — “THE HAT TOSS CHAIN”**

**INT. KITTYKAT24’S ROOM – NIGHT**

Kitty is kneeling on her bed, hair in a messy half-bun, holding a floppy sunhat with fake flowers on it. She’s trying very hard to look serious.

**KITTY**  
“Okay. Precision. Synchronization. Grace.  
We are ballet.”

**INT. KAI’S APARTMENT – SAME**

Kai squints skeptically at the ball cap he’s holding.

**KAI**  
“I don’t think ballet involves hats, Kitty.”

**KITTY (V.O.)**  
“It does TONIGHT.”

**INT. SKATTERBRAIN’S ROOM – SAME**

SkatterBrain is adjusting a beanie dramatically, like he’s about to walk a runway.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“Let the art begin.”

**KITTY (V.O.)**  
“Okay— Kai throws first.  
I catch.  
Then I toss to Skatter.  
Easy.”

Kai nods. Very serious.  
He raises his hat like he’s lining up a perfect curveball.

**KAI**  
“On three.  
One—”

He immediately YEETS the hat off-frame.

**KITTY**  
(screaming)  
“KAI!!  
THAT WAS ZERO!  
THAT WAS NEGATIVE ONE!”

Kitty flails backward on her bed, cackling.  
SkatterBrain falls out of his chair laughing.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“My dude threw it before the thought even finished forming—”

Kai covers his face, laughing so hard he can’t breathe.

**KAI**  
“I panicked! My arm betrayed me!”

Kitty resets, breathless.

**KITTY**  
“Okay. For real this time.  
Three.  
Two.  
One—”

Kai tosses his hat.  
Kitty reaches for it—  
and mistimes completely, grabbing at empty air.

The hat bounces off her shoulder and disappears behind the bed.

She collapses.  
Silent laugh. Full-body shake.

**KITTY**  
“CUT! CUT!  
We’ll fix it in post!”

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“We are NOT nailing this.  
We are not even nailing the concept of numbers.”

Kai’s laughing so hard he slides halfway out of frame.

**KAI**  
“One more.  
I swear.  
We’re geniuses. We got this.”

Kitty wipes tears from her eyes.

**KITTY**  
“We absolutely do not.”

But they line up again anyway —  
because the fun is the failure.

**CUT.**

# ⭐ **INTERCUT SEQUENCE — “THE STREAMER POP-IN”**

**INT. KAI’S APARTMENT – NIGHT**

Kai sits comfortably in his chair, one hand on his drink, one arm resting lazily on the armrest. He hears something through his headset and smirks.

**KAI**  
“Oh god… he’s doing the voice again.”

**INTERCUT TO:**

**INT. KITTYKAT24’S ROOM – SAME**

Kitty is on her bed, filing her nails with military focus. The streamer’s exaggerated intro hits her headphones.

She doesn’t even look up.

**KITTY**  
(under her breath)  
“He’s two minutes in and already embarrassing himself.”

**INTERCUT TO:**

**INT. SKATTERBRAIN’S ROOM – SAME**

SkatterBrain’s chair squeaks as he adjusts forward, annoyed before anything even happens.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“If he starts another fake sponsorship rant— I’m logging off.”

**STREAMER (V.O., faint, through all their headsets)**  
“Aaaaand who do we have here?  
Kai.  
Kitty.  
Brainrot.”

**INTERCUT BACK TO:**

**SKATTERBRAIN**

SkatterBrain instantly flips off the unseen monitor.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“He does NOT get to call me that.  
Not after last Saturday.”

**INTERCUT TO:**

**KITTY**

Kitty switches her nail file to the other hand, totally unfazed.

**KITTY**  
“You named yourself SkatterBrain.  
He upgraded you.”

**INTERCUT TO:**

**KAI**

Kai stretches back like a cat, relaxed and amused.

**KAI**  
“He’s been saving that one.  
Probably practiced in a mirror.”

**STREAMER (V.O.)**  
“Chat, FYI? These three griefed my whole lobby last week.”

**INTERCUT: KITTY**

Kitty rolls her eyes dramatically.

**KITTY**  
“We carried him.  
He begged.  
Historical revisionism.”

**INTERCUT: SKATTERBRAIN**

SkatterBrain nods emphatically, leaning too close to his mic.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“Tell the people the truth, coward.”

**INTERCUT: KAI**

Kai leans in, smirking.

**KAI**  
“We love you too, man.”

**STREAMER (V.O.)**  
“Yeah, yeah. Anyway— they’re team lead tonight.  
If they wipe, I’m blaming them.”

**INTERCUT: KITTY**

Kitty groans, flopping backward onto her pillows.

**KITTY**  
“Ugh. Responsibility. Gross.”

**INTERCUT: SKATTERBRAIN**

He taps his chest theatrically.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“Don’t worry, Kitty.  
We’ll throw.  
As is tradition.”

**INTERCUT: KAI**

Kai shrugs, lifting his drink.

**KAI**  
“You know the rules…  
we grief him, he griefs us.  
Circle of life.”

All three settle into their chairs —  
three different rooms, one shared vibe.

**END INTERCUT.**

# ⭐ **INTERCUT SEQUENCE — “THE GOFUNDME (CLEAN, NATURAL VERSION)”**

**INT. KITTYKAT24’S ROOM – NIGHT**

Kitty is stretched across her bed, scrolling her phone casually while the others chatter.  
She pauses.  
Brows lift.

**KITTY**  
“Oh— hey, Skatter.  
What’s this link you just posted on Insta?”

**INTERCUT TO:**

**INT. SKATTERBRAIN’S ROOM – SAME**

SkatterBrain doesn’t flinch.  
Just shrugs, sipping from a can.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“Oh.  
My uncle’s GoFundMe.  
Hospital bill stuff.”

**INTERCUT TO:**

**INT. KAI’S APARTMENT – SAME**

Kai perks up, leaning a little closer to his mic.

**KAI**  
“Send it.”

Kitty already is.  
Her thumbs move fast.

**KITTY (V.O.)**  
“Just did.  
Sucks, man.  
Hope he’s doing okay.”

SkatterBrain nods once — not emotional, not guarded — just matter-of-fact.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“Yeah, he’s hanging in there.”

**INTERCUT TO: KITTY**

She taps on her screen a few times, sits upright slightly.

**KITTY**  
“I tossed in a few bucks.  
Nothing wild.  
Just— you know.”

**INTERCUT TO: KAI**

Kai’s already doing the same on his phone.

**KAI**  
“Me too.”

**INTERCUT BACK TO: SKATTERBRAIN**

SkatterBrain smiles — a real one — small, warm.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“Thanks, guys.  
Seriously.”

**INTERCUT: KITTY**

She waves a hand dismissively, even though they can’t see it.

**KITTY**  
“Dude, please.  
We’re friends.  
That’s what this is.”

**INTERCUT: KAI**

Kai nods, relaxed.

**KAI**  
“Yeah.  
Love you, man.”

**INTERCUT: SKATTERBRAIN**

He smirks, leaning back in his chair like he’s brushing off embarrassment he doesn’t actually feel.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“Love you too, dorks.”

They sit in a comfortable, unforced silence for half a beat —  
then someone burps, or coughs, or rustles a chip bag,  
and life just… continues.

**END INTERCUT.**

# ⭐ **FINALE INTERCUT — “PIZZA COLLAGE”**

_(Final sequence of Episode 3 — 400+ words, cinematic, rhythmic, montage-driven)_

**EXT. BOURBON STREET – NIGHT**

Maya, Samir, and Chloë weave through the crowd, sweat-damp and glowing from the neon. The noise is still loud, but their energy has softened — the post-adventure lull.

Chloë slows first.

**CHLOË**  
“Okay… is it just me…  
or am I starving?”

**WIPE-PAN TO:**

**INT. KAI’S APARTMENT – SAME**

Kai is reclined in his chair, hand on his stomach.

**KAI**  
“I’m hungry.”

**WIPE-PAN TO:**

Kitty pauses mid-scroll, raises her hand like she’s confessing in class.

**KITTY**  
“Same.”

**WIPE-PAN TO:**

**INT. SKATTERBRAIN’S ROOM – SAME**

SkatterBrain stops mid-rant about something stupid, blinks.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“…me three.”

**CUT BACK TO:**

**EXT. BOURBON STREET**

Maya lifts her hands in surrender.

**MAYA**  
“Food.  
Now.”

Samir nods emphatically.

**SAMIR**  
“I don’t even care what.”

Chloë giggles.

**CHLOË**  
“Same.”

**WIPE-PAN — FAST, MUSICAL — THROUGH ALL SIX FACES**

Kai → Kitty → Skatter → Maya → Samir → Chloë  
Each saying some version of:

**“What do we even eat?”**  
**“No idea.”**  
**“Something greasy.”**  
**“Something fast.”**  
**“Anything.”**

The audio overlaps — not chaotic, but rhythmic, like a beat.

Then:

A moment of stillness.

All six faces, side by side in a **six-way split screen**, eyes tracking something unseen.

**ALL OF THEM**  
“Pizza.”

A beautiful, stupid, communal decision.

**CUT TO WIDE COLLAGE:**

# ⭐ **THE PIZZA MONTAGE**

**EXT. FRENCH QUARTER PIZZA SHOP – NIGHT**

Maya spots it first.  
She gasps dramatically.

**MAYA**  
“Oh hell YES.”

Samir throws his hands up in victory.  
Chloë takes Maya’s arm and the trio _skip_ toward the glowing storefront like drunk children.

**INSIDE:**

They collapse into a red vinyl booth.  
Three enormous slices hit the table.  
Steam rises.  
Cheese stretches.  
They moan in ecstatic unison.

**CHLOË**  
“Worth it.”

**SAMIR**  
“Worth everything.”

**WIPE-PAN TO:**

**INT. SKATTERBRAIN’S ROOM – SAME**

SkatterBrain is hunched before his toaster oven, staring through the glass like he’s communicating with the spirits.

The tiny frozen pizza rotates slowly.

SkatterBrain whispers reverently:

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“Cook, my son.”

**DING.**

He rips it out, hops onto his bed, folds the slice like a New Yorker, takes a massive bite—

—and immediately burns his tongue.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
(shrieking)  
“HOT—  
Hot— hot— HOT— why is it SO HOT—???”

He keeps eating anyway.

**WIPE-PAN TO:**

**INT. KITTYKAT24’S HOUSE – SAME**

Kitty wanders downstairs into a quiet, too-big, softly lit kitchen.

She opens the fridge.  
Inside: a half-eaten pizza box from a place fancy people pretend is casual.

She steals a cold slice like she’s breaking into a vault.

Takes a bite.  
Her eyes close with bliss.

**KITTY**  
“Mmm. Religious.”

**WIPE-PAN TO:**

**INT. KAI’S APARTMENT – SAME**

Kai scrolls his food app with the focus of a sniper.

**KAI**  
“C’mon… be open… be open…”

He taps.  
Swipes.  
Selects.  
Waits.

**DOORBELL RINGS.**

Kai lights up.

He snatches the box from the delivery guy, drops back into his chair, opens the lid like it’s treasure.

One bite.  
Full exhale.

**KAI**  
“Yum.”

# ⭐ **FINAL SHOT**

**SIX-WAY SPLIT SCREEN:**

- Maya biting her slice, laughing through melted cheese
    
- Samir devouring his like a caveman
    
- Chloë snapping a photo of Maya mid-bite
    
- SkatterBrain fanning his burnt tongue but still eating
    
- Kitty blissed out from cold pizza nirvana
    
- Kai reclined in his chair, box in his lap, perfectly content
    

The ambient sounds fade.  
_Dark Rain_ settles into a soft outro version.

Six worlds.  
Six rooms.  
Six slices.

One moment.

**CUT TO BLACK.**
