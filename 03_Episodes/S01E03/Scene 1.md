_(Before the title card, before music fully rises.)_

## **INT. MAYA’S APARTMENT – NIGHT**

**CLOSE ON** Maya’s lips in the mirror.  
She’s applying lipstick with razor precision — then pauses, considers,  smudges it with her fingertip to make it rougher.  Perfect.

Chloe (O.S.):

> “MAYAAA, let’s goooo! I’m thirsty!”

Maya checks herself one last time.

**CLOSE SHOT:**  
Her hand runs through her hair — fast, chaotic.  
She smiles at herself.  
It’s the “tonight is ours” smile.

She grabs her phone.  
Full charge.  
Full bars.

She kills the bathroom light.

**CUT TO BLACK — boom — we switch worlds.**

---

## **INT. KAI’S BEDROOM – SAME NIGHT**

**HARD CUT** to the glow of RGB LEDs.

Kai adjusts his headset, looking at himself in the webcam image.

He fixes a stray piece of hair with his palm.  

He taps his mic.

**Discord connects — little bloop-bloop sounds.**  

KittyKat94:

> “Yoo! Kaiii! There he is!”

SkatterBrain:

> “Let’s go, squad’s back tonight!”

Kai sits forward, excited.

Kai:

> “Okay — tonight? Nobody dips.  
> No random AFKs.  
> We’re actually staying together.”

They all cheer.
  

**CUT TO—**

---

## **INT. MAYA’S APARTMENT – NIGHT**

Maya opens the door.  
Chloe is waiting with three other friends, all chaotic energy.

Maya (grabbing Chloe’s wrist):

> “We stick together tonight, okay?  
> I’m serious.  
> LIKE.  
> Super serious.”

Everyone laughs.

**Cue DRAMA – “Dark Rain” (slow fade-in).**

---

## **INTERCUT — MAYA AND KAI LEAVING THEIR WORLDS**

**MAYA’S GROUP - INT: Maya's House:**  
Pouring out into the hallway, heels clacking, glitter everywhere, laughing.  Heavy "night-out" energy.

**KAI’S CREW - INT: Respective Computers:**  
Someone’s cat walks across their keyboard.  
Someone else’s mic peaks.  
Someone is already eating chips too loudly.

SPLIT SCREEN:

Kai (smiling big):

> “Okay! Staying together.  
> No one vanish.”

**Maya:**

> “Okay! Staying together.  
> No one vanish.”

**Perfect overlay moment.**

One spoken IRL.  
One spoken digitally.  
Same line.  
Same rhythm.  
Same youthful hope.  
Different worlds.

---

## **EXT. MAYA’S STREET – NIGHT**

Door swings open — Bourbon Street lights already distant but calling.

**CLOSE on Maya’s face** as streetlamp reflections hit her eyes.

She steps out into the heat, noise, and chaos of the city.

---

## **INT. KAI’S ROOM**

Kai pulls his rolling chair closer.  
Monitor glow washes him in soft blue.

Episode 3:  Connection

### EXT. TREMÉ – EARLY EVENING

The street is _quiet but alive._

Not abandoned — **resting.**

MAYA, CHLOE, and SAMIR spill out of Maya’s shotgun house and into the street like kids released from gravity. There’s an ease to them here. This isn’t a place they pass through — it’s a place that _knows them._

They **skip**, half-dancing to the low pulse of _Dark Rain_, bodies loose, movement unselfconscious. Chloe exaggerates her steps, swinging her arms wide. Samir performs exaggeratedly. Maya laughs — not performative, not guarded — _home-laugh._

They pass a row of **stoop-sitters** — older locals, watching the evening arrive.

A nod.  
A smile.  
A casual wave.

> **STOOP-SITTER**  
> (calling out)  
> Evening, Maya.

She turns without slowing.

> **MAYA**  
> Evening.


The camera walks with them.


They cross an intersection where chalk drawings from some unseen kids still stain the sidewalk. Chloe hops over them. Samir deliberately steps _through_ one, earning a mock shove from Chloe.

Maya watches them for a beat.

As they move farther, the street subtly changes. The quiet hum of Tremé gives way to **distant bass**, neon glow bleeding into the edges of frame.

The light shifts as they walk — color deepens, sound thickens. Far ahead, neon begins to glow. The street widens. The night opens up.

Maya looks forward, eyes bright.

Bourbon Street waits.

They pick up speed, laughter spilling ahead of them as they move toward the noise, the lights, the night — bodies in motion, completely in sync.

**CUT.**

### INTERCUT – KAI / KITTYKAT / SKATTERBRAIN – NIGHT

**KAI’S ROOM**

_Dark Rain_ rides.

Kai rocks in his chair, shoulders loose, head nodding. He takes a long pull from an energy drink, exhales like life is good.

> **KAI**  
> Man… can you believe that Crunknado clip is trending?

He grins, already stirring the pot.

---

**SKATTERBRAIN’S ROOM**

Skatterbrain jerks upright like he’s been waiting his whole life for this moment.

> **SKATTERBRAIN**  
> That was _bullshit!_

He’s halfway out of his chair.

> **SKATTERBRAIN (CONT’D)**  
> Lucky fucking headshot!

---

**KITTYKAT’S ROOM**

Kittykat laughs chaotically — then commits.

She _exaggeratedly_ falls out of her chair, vanishing out of frame.

> **KITTYKAT (O.S.)**  
> Oh my _GOD!_

A beat. A crash.

She pops back up, laughing.

> **KITTYKAT (CONT’D)**  
> Spoken like a true noob.


> **KITTYKAT**  
> Take your medicine, Skatter — he _got_ you.


---

**KAI**

Kai leans back, hands behind his head, completely in his element.

> **KAI**  
> Acceptance’s the first stage.

---

**SKATTERBRAIN**

Points at camera, righteous.

> **SKATTERBRAIN**  
> I reject that entire timeline.

---

Kittykat howls. Kai laughs, chair still rocking as the music carries them forward.

**CUT.**

---

**EXT. BOURBON STREET – NIGHT**

The crowd opens just enough for a pocket of space —  
glow from a neon beer sign strobes across the pavement.

A kid sits on an upside-down bucket,  
feet planted wide,  
drumming on another bucket between his knees.  
A third bucket sits out front with a few bills softening in the humidity.

His sticks click and slap in a looping pattern that cuts through the street noise.

Maya stops mid-stride.  
Her hips fall into the beat like gravity found her.

Chloë steps beside her, matching the sway,  
fingertips flicking little syncopated shapes in the air.  
Samir melts in last, shoulder pops and goofy shuffles.

The three of them form a tiny, accidental circle around the kid —  
no audience, no performance, just  
**their bodies catching a rhythm because it’s there.**

The kid looks up for half a heartbeat —  
not breaking rhythm .

The trio rides the beat for a few seconds more,  
laughing under their breath.
They each drop a couple dollars.
then drift forward again,  
still carrying the rhythm in their steps.

Behind them, the kid keeps drumming,  
same tempo, same buckets,  
folded seamlessly back into the night.

**CUT.**

**INT. KAI’S APARTMENT – NIGHT**

Kai leans forward in his chair, fingers flying, eyes glued to the unseen screen.

**KAI**  
“Ohhhh my god— SKATTER, WHERE ARE YOU?!”

**INT. SKATTERBRAIN’S ROOM – SAME**

SkatterBrain is half out of his chair, body angled sideways like he’s dodging something.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
(screaming)  
“I’M RIGHT HERE, I’M RIGHT HERE— DON’T YELL AT ME— I’M CONTRIBUTING!”

He absolutely is not contributing.

**INT. KITTYKAT24’S ROOM – SAME**

Kitty is centered in her chair, calm as a monk, sipping from a mug.

**KITTY**  
“You two are chaos gremlins. Watch and learn.”

She suddenly gasps.

**KITTY**  
“Oh— OH! OH LET’S GO— did you SEE that?!”

**KAI (V.O.)**  
“Ohhh Kitty popped OFF— SKATTER, DID YOU SEE HER?!”

**SKATTERBRAIN (V.O.)**  
“I SAW IT, I SAW IT, I SAW ALL OF IT— Kitty out here doing GOD’S WORK—”

Suddenly:

**KAI**  
(screaming)  
“HE’S BEHIND YOU, HE’S BEHIND YOU— SKATTER, TURN AROUND— TURN AROUND!”

SkatterBrain spins so hard in his chair he nearly falls out of frame.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“DON’T TELL ME TO TURN AROUND— TELL ME WHY YOU LET HIM GET BEHIND ME!!”

**KITTY (V.O.)**  
(laughing uncontrollably)  
“You two are so dramatic— Kai breathe— SKATTER breathe— EVERYBODY BREATHE—”

Kai slams both hands on the desk in triumph.

**KAI**  
“YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS— EASY CLAP— SOMEBODY CLIP THAT— CLIP IT—”

Kitty screams laughing.

Kai jumps out of his chair and launches into a victory dance.

**KAI**  
“GET REKT— SIT DOWN— UNINSTALL— DELETE THE GAME— DELETE YOUR LIFE—”

**KITTY**  
(cry-laughing)  
“Kai, Kai— babe— breathe. You’re too into it.”

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“No no no don’t breathe— this is his final form— let him COOK—”


They dissolve into overlapping chaos, laughter, and shrieking.

Three rooms, one rhythm.

**CUT.**

---

**BOURBON STREET – SMALL BAR**

Hands slide drinks across a worn wooden bar.

Maya receives hers first. Cold glass. Condensation. She smiles like this is exactly where she’s supposed to be.

Chloe’s wine glass follows — elegant, unhurried.  
Samir’s drink lands last — heavier, confident.

They gather close.

> **CHLOE**  
> Cheers!

Glasses meet. A clean, bright _clink_.

They drink.

Maya’s eyes close for half a second — pure enjoyment.

---

**KITTYKAT’S ROOM**

Kittykat leans into frame, chanting at full volume.

> **KITTYKAT**  
> Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

She pounds her desk like it’s a stadium.

---

**KAI’S ROOM**

Kai drinks from an absurdly large energy drink.

He doesn’t hesitate.

He _commits_.

A long, heroic chug. Adam’s apple working overtime.

He finally comes up for air, wipes his mouth with the back of his hand.

> **KAI**  
> Oh my god.



---


**SKATTERBRAIN’S ROOM**

Skatterbrain lifts his beer, calmer, ceremonial.

A beat.

> SKATTERBRAIN**  
> Either you just went Super Saiyan…  
> or lost ten years of your life.

He takes a solid sip. Nods, approving his own choice.

---

**BACK TO BOURBON STREET**

Samir throws an arm around Maya’s shoulders as they step away from the bar, drinks in hand. The street explodes with color and sound around them.

Chloe takes another sip of wine, savoring it, eyes bright.

> **CHLOE**  
> Perfect.

They melt into the crowd, laughter trailing behind them.

---

**BACK TO KAI**

Kai vibrates in his chair, suddenly unstoppable.

> **KAI**  
> I can hear colors.

---

**KITTYKAT**

Raises her drink to the camera.

> **KITTYKAT**  
> To terrible decisions!

---

**SKATTERBRAIN**

Raises his beer a beat later.

> **SKATTERBRAIN**  
> To greatness.

---

**INTERCUT – QUICK FLASHES**

– Maya laughing mid-sip  
– Chloe swirling her wine  
– Samir downing his drink  
– Kittykat cheering  
– Skatterbrain nodding  
– Kai shaking out his hands, buzzing with energy

All different rooms.  
One shared night.

The music carries them forward.

**CUT.**

---

**EXT. BOURBON STREET – NIGHT**

The trio drifts behind a group of tourists — drinks in hand, gawking upward at balconies.

A sharp-dressed street hustler slides up beside one of the guys.

**HUSTLER**  
“Hey man, nice shoes.  
Bet you five dollars I can tell you where you got ’em.”

The tourist grins, already suspicious but amused.

**TOURIST**  
“Oh yeah? Try me.”

The hustler squares up, milking the moment, building anticipation.

Maya, Chloë, and Samir watch from a few steps away — smiling like they’re seeing an old friend tell a beloved joke.

The hustler leans in, dramatic as hell.

**HUSTLER**  
“You got them…”

He lifts his hands like a magician about to reveal a rabbit.

Maya can’t help herself —  
she blurts with a huge grin:

**MAYA**  
“ON BOURBON STREET!”

Chloë and Samir jump right in, shouting with her:

**CHLOË & SAMIR**  
“ON BOURBON STREET!”

A small crowd turns to look.

The tourist bursts out laughing.

The hustler throws his arms up like he’s onstage at the Saenger.

**HUSTLER**  
“THAT’S RIGHT, BABY!  
SHOES!
ON!  
BOURBON!  
STREET!”

He does a quick victory shuffle —  
and Maya, Chloë, Samir join him in a little celebratory dance circle.

The tourist, caught up in the moment, does a clumsy shimmy to join in.

Everyone’s laughing —  
nobody feels conned,  
everybody feels _included_.

The tourist pulls a crumpled five from his pocket and hands it over with a salute.

The hustler pockets the bill smoothly.

**HUSTLER**  
“See? City loves you. Treat her right.”

He high-fives Maya as he floats off into the night toward his next mark.

The trio keeps walking, sharing a little bounce from the leftover rhythm.

They laugh, disappearing back into the neon river.

**CUT.**

**INT. KITTYKAT24’S ROOM – NIGHT**

Kitty is leaned ALL the way back in her chair, phone held above her face, squinting hard.

**KITTY**  
“This is the dumbest thing I’ve ever read. I swear. My brain is melting.”

She scrolls aggressively (we don’t see the screen), eyebrows climbing her forehead.

**KITTY**  
(reading)  
“Oh my god— ‘the pigeons are government agents.’  
Stop. Absolutely stop.”

**INT. SKATTERBRAIN’S ROOM – SAME**

SkatterBrain is hunched over his desk, hands covering half his face like he’s bracing for impact.


**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“WHY would a spy DRONE poop?!”

**INT. KAI’S APARTMENT – SAME**

Kai has both hands pressed to his forehead, staring at the unseen screen like he’s witnessing a national tragedy.

KITTYKAT24'S ROOM - NIGHT

Kitty gasps sharply.

**KITTY**  
“Oh God. Oh God it gets worse.  
It says— hang on, I have to say this in full dramatic monologue—”

She sits up straight, eyes wide.

**KITTY**  
(delivering like Shakespeare)  
‘The pigeons are recharging using THE SUN.’”

A beat.

Then Kai SNORTS.

SkatterBrain SCREAM-laughs.

**KAI**  
“No. Absolutely not. I refuse. I reject the lore.”

Kitty keeps scrolling, horrified.

**KITTY**  
“There’s diagrams. There are— there are IMAGES. I’m going to puke.”

Kai leans in like he’s about to witness a crime scene.

**KAI**  
“How detailed are these diagrams?”

**KITTY**  
“Like way too detailed. Like… you could build your OWN government pigeon.”

**SKATTERBRAIN (V.O.)**  
“Oh perfect. DIY espionage. Pinterest but unhinged.”

Kitty suddenly stops scrolling, staring in abject disbelief.

**KITTY**  
“Guys.  
GUYS.  
They have step-by-step instructions.”

Kai slides back in his chair like he’s been hit.

**KAI**  
“Oh my god. We’re gonna get put on a list.”

SkatterBrain throws both hands in the air.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“This is how I go to prison.  
Because Kitty read me PIGEON FANFICTION.”

Kitty wipes tears from her eyes, laughing.

**KITTY**  
“I didn’t write it! I’m the victim!”
“…What if it’s right, though?”

Kitty screams.  
SkatterBrain screams.  
Kai screams.
All three dissolve into absolute chaos.

**CUT.**

---

EXT. BOURBON STREET -NIGHT

As they walk past an open bar door, a heavy bass hit blasts out —  
Samir jumps into a half-two-step,  
Chloë does one sharp shoulder roll,  
Maya gives a tiny hip snap.

The door swings shut.  
Silence again.

CUT.

---

INT. KAI'S ROOM - NIGHT

Kai kills the overhead light.  
Room goes black except for pulsing RGB strips.

He raises both hands and does a slow, fluid rave-style dance —  
wrists swirling, shoulders rolling,  
color washes across his skin.

**CUT.**

---

INT. KITTY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Kitty turns off her ring light,  
keeps only her LED backglow.  
She steps back,  
hair loose,  
arms up —  
and does a slow, sensual, self-contained dance  
like she’s headlining her own private club.

**CUT.**

---

INT. SKATTER'S ROOM -NIGHT

Skatter sways to the music...beer in hand..takes a sip.  He waves his phone as if he's at a concert.

He spins his chair around..full 360.  drinks...spins again.

---

**EXT. BOURBON STREET SIDE ALCOVE – NIGHT**

The noise thins just enough for a different texture to settle in —  
candles flickering in colored glass jars,  
incense curling in slow ribbons,  
a small folding table draped in deep plum fabric.

Behind it sits **MAYA’S MOM**, mid-50s, warm-eyed, silver streaks in her braids,  
a stack of tarot cards in her hands.  
She looks more like a favorite aunt than a mystic —  
comfortable, grounded, unmistakably local.

A tourist couple stands, thanking her softly, tucking her business card into a purse.

As they leave, Maya spots her.

Her whole face lights up.

She rushes forward.

**MAYA**  
“Mama!”

Her mother stands to meet her —  
and they fold into a hug that looks like muscle memory.

Chloë and Samir are right behind, grinning.

**CHLOË**  
“Hey, mama LeFevre!”

**SAMIR**  
“Looking radiant, as always.”

Maya’s mom pulls them both into side hugs, kissing each of their cheeks.

**MAYA’S MOM**  
“Oh my babies are out causing trouble tonight, I see.”

Maya rolls her eyes, but she’s glowing — this is comfort, this is home.

Her mom cups Maya’s face gently between her palms for a second.

**MAYA’S MOM**  
“You look happy.”

Maya shrugs with a tiny smile she tries to hide.

**MAYA**  
“I’m good.  
We’re just wandering.”

Her mom taps her tarot deck lightly, as if to say _‘I see more than you’re saying’.

**MAYA’S MOM**  
“Wander safe.  
The Quarter is loud tonight.”

Maya’s mom laughs — that deep, warm kind that fills everything around her.

She squeezes Maya’s hand.

Chloë kisses Maya’s mom on the cheek before they go.

**CHLOË**  
“We’ll bring her home in one piece.”

Her mom waves them off.

The trio slips back into the street,  
the noise swelling again as the quiet pocket closes behind them.

**CUT.**

---

**INT. KAI’S APARTMENT – NIGHT**

Kai sits comfortably in his chair, one hand on his drink, one arm resting lazily on the armrest. He listens to a streamer through his headset and smirks.

**INTERCUT TO:**

**INT. KITTYKAT24’S ROOM – SAME**

Kitty is on her bed, filing her nails with military focus. The streamer’s exaggerated intro hits her headphones.

She doesn’t even look up.

**KITTY**  
(under her breath)  
“He’s two minutes in and already embarrassing himself.”

**INTERCUT TO:**

**INT. SKATTERBRAIN’S ROOM – SAME**

SkatterBrain’s chair squeaks as he adjusts forward, annoyed before anything even happens.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“If he starts another fake sponsorship rant— I’m logging off.”

**STREAMER (V.O., faint, through all their headsets)**  
“Aaaaand who do we have here?  
Kai.  
Kitty.  
Brainrot.”

**INTERCUT BACK TO:**

**SKATTERBRAIN**

SkatterBrain instantly flips off the unseen monitor.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“He does NOT get to call me that.  
Not after last Saturday.”

**INTERCUT TO:**

**KITTY**

Kitty switches her nail file to the other hand, totally unfazed.

**KITTY**  
“You named yourself SkatterBrain.  
He upgraded you.”

**INTERCUT TO:**

**KAI**

Kai stretches back like a cat, relaxed and amused.

**KAI**  
“He’s been saving that one.  
Probably practiced in a mirror.”

**STREAMER (V.O.)**  
“Chat, FYI? These three griefed my whole lobby last week.”

**INTERCUT: KITTY**

Kitty rolls her eyes dramatically.

**KITTY**  
“We carried him.  
He begged.  
Historical revisionism.”

**INTERCUT: SKATTERBRAIN**

SkatterBrain nods emphatically, leaning too close to his mic.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“Tell the people the truth, coward.”

**INTERCUT: KAI**

Kai leans in, smirking.

**KAI**  
“We love you too, man.”

**STREAMER (V.O.)**  
“Yeah, yeah. Anyway— they’re team lead tonight.  
If they wipe, I’m blaming them.”

**INTERCUT: KITTY**

Kitty groans, flopping backward onto her pillows.

**KITTY**  
“Ugh. Responsibility. Gross.”

**INTERCUT: SKATTERBRAIN**

He taps his chest theatrically.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“Don’t worry, Kitty.  
We’ll throw.  
As is tradition.”

**INTERCUT: KAI**

Kai shrugs, lifting his drink.

**KAI**  
“You know the rules…  
we grief him, he griefs us.  
Circle of life.”

All three settle into their chairs —  
three different rooms, one shared vibe.

**END INTERCUT.**

### INTERCUT MONTAGE – CHEAP DRINKS – NIGHT

The beat rides.

---

**BOURBON STREET – DIVE BAR**

Samir already has his plastic cup in hand, eyes lit up.

> **SAMIR**  
> Yes!

He downs it like a victory lap.

Chloe inspects hers for half a second.

> **CHLOE**  
> …Okay. Whatever.

She shrugs and drinks — not thrilled, not defeated.

Maya holds her cup at arm’s length, unimpressed.

> **MAYA**  
> Really?  
> You’re gonna make me do this?

Samir is already smiling at her over the rim of his empty cup.

Maya sighs, then commits.

She drinks. Hard.

She exhales, shakes it off.

> **MAYA (CONT’D)**  
> I hate that you’re enjoying this.

Samir cheers.

---

**KAI’S ROOM**

Kai pours clear liquid into a shot glass.

He slams it.

Immediate regret.

He winces, breathes through his nose.

He pours another.

---

**KITTYKAT’S ROOM**

Kittykat lounges, wine glass in hand.

She takes a small, elegant sip, completely unbothered.

A knowing smile.

---

**SKATTERBRAIN’S ROOM**

Skatterbrain leans in, enjoying the show.

> **SKATTERBRAIN**  
> Suck it up, Kai.  
> Puts hair on your chest.

He pours his own shot — darker.

Whiskey.

Shoots it clean. Smirks.

---

**BACK TO BOURBON STREET**

Chloe wipes her mouth, laughs despite herself.

> **CHLOE**  
> That is… aggressive.

Samir is already bouncing, energized.

Maya shakes out her hands, eyes bright now.

---

**BACK TO KAI**

Kai throws back the second shot.

His face contorts.

> **KAI**  
> Nope.

---

**KITTYKAT**

Raises her glass.

> **KITTYKAT**  
> Balance.

Another sip.

---

**SKATTERBRAIN**

> **SKATTERBRAIN**  
> Character-building.

**INTERCUT – QUICK FLASHES**

– Samir laughing  
– Chloe smiling  
– Maya recovering  
– Kai pacing  
– Kittykat serene  
– Skatterbrain smug

Same night.  
Same energy.

The music carries them forward.

**CUT.**

Kitty is sprawled on her bed, one knee up, painting her toenails with practiced precision.  
Laptop glow washes half her face; the other half flickers with pink LED light.  
Her headset sits crooked on her head — one ear on, one ear off.

She wiggles her toes proudly.

**KITTY**  
“Okay, honest question…  
you think I could do foot porn?”

**INT. KAI’S APARTMENT – SAME**

Kai jerks upright in his chair like he just heard a war crime.

**KAI**  
“WHAT— Kitty, what the— NO.  
Absolutely not.  
You’re better than that. Jesus.”

**KITTY (V.O.)**  
(laughing)  
“Relax. It’s a market. A _big_ market.”

**INT. SKATTERBRAIN’S ROOM – SAME**

SkatterBrain is mid-sip of soda.  
He chokes, sputters, wipes his face.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“Girl, no. NO. You can’t. You can’t do that.  
Actually… I mean… your feet _are_ kinda cute—”

**KITTY (V.O.)**  
“SEE?! Validation!”

Kai slaps his own forehead.

**KAI**  
“Oh my god.  
No, Kitty. No.  
You’re gonna get weird uncles named ‘ToeLover92’ in your DMs.”

Kitty lifts her foot toward the unseen webcam.

**KITTY**  
“Whatever. I have good arches. This is God’s work.”

SkatterBrain leans all the way back in his chair, groaning dramatically.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“She’s not Kai.  
Have you seen her Fortnite stats?  
Feet might be her only calling.”

**KITTY**  
“How _dare_ you—”

**KAI (V.O.)**  
“He’s not wrong, though.”

**KITTY**  
“I _WAS_ lagging!”

Kai points a finger at the unseen screen like he’s lecturing her.

**KAI**  
“Kitty. My friend. My dude.  
‘Lag’ doesn’t explain walking off a roof.”

Kitty gasps dramatically, clutching her chest.

**KITTY**  
“Are you saying I’m bad at the game?”

SkatterBrain jumps in instantly.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“No, no— he’s saying you’re PERFECT ... for OnlyFeet.  
Embrace your destiny.”

**KITTY**  
“You’re both trash.”

Kitty kicks her foot toward the webcam like she’s about to stomp them through the internet.

**KITTY**  
“BLOCKED.”

They all dissolve into overlapping laughter —  
genuine, stupid, late-night laughter.

**CUT.**

---

**INT. KAI’S APARTMENT – NIGHT**

Kai is mid-sentence — animated, ranting about God-knows-what — when he suddenly freezes.

His face goes flat.

He taps his headphones.

**KAI**  
“…hello?”

He looks left.  
Looks right.  
Taps the side of his PC tower like he’s knocking on a neighbor’s door.

Silence.

A little LED on his desktop flickers.  
Then dies.

Kai’s eyes go wide.

**KAI**  
“Oh, come ON— not now— NOT— NOW—”

He flies out of his chair, full panic, pacing in a tight line.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. KITTYKAT24’S ROOM – SAME**

Kitty squints at her unseen screen, then makes a sad, theatrical pout.

**KITTY**  
“Oh no…  
We lost Kai.”

She sighs dramatically, flopping back on her bed like she’s fainting.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. SKATTERBRAIN’S ROOM – SAME**

SkatterBrain leans WAY into his webcam, whispering like it’s a memorial service.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“He lived stupidly.  
He died stupidly.  
He will be remembered— briefly.”

Kitty snorts off-screen.

**KITTY (V.O.)**  
“Guess we’re on our own now.”

**CUT BACK TO:**

**INT. KAI’S APARTMENT – SAME**

Kai is rebooting EVERYTHING:

- slams the power button
    
- flips his router like a pancake
    
- whispers threats at his equipment
    

**KAI**  
(snarling)  
“Work. Work. WORK.  
You useless beige TIME CAPSULE—”

He stops.  
Thinks.  
Eyes widen.

He grabs his phone like it’s Excalibur.

**KAI**  
“THANK YOU GOD FOR CREATING HOTSPOTS ON THE EIGHTH DAY.”

He taps, swipes, taps again — frantic, breathless.

A green indicator light on his PC flares back to life.

Kai gasps.

Throws himself into his chair.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. SKATTERBRAIN’S ROOM – SAME**

SkatterBrain jolts upright.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“KAI!!  
HE LIVES!”

**INT. KITTYKAT24’S ROOM – SAME**

Kitty claps her hands in delight.

**KITTY**  
“WELCOME BACK TO EXISTENCE!”

**CUT TO:**

**INT. KAI’S ROOM – SAME**

Kai holds his arms out like a resurrected messiah.

**KAI**  
“My children…  
I have returned.”

All three collapse into chaotic, overlapping laughter.

**CUT.**

**EXT. BOURBON STREET – NIGHT**

Maya is mid-laugh — head tipped back, cheeks flushed from the last burst of dancing.

She turns to share the moment with her friends—

But the space beside her is empty.

Her smile falters.

She turns left.  
Right.  
Nothing.

Just **a shifting wall of strangers** spilling through the street — beads, neon drinks, feathers, camera flashes.  
The music from each bar blends into a blurred roar.

The camera circles Maya slowly —  
faces passing, lights streaking, the noise pressing in.

She stands still for a moment, breathing through it, eyes scanning above the crowd.

No panic.  
Just a sudden smallness.

She starts walking — slow, steady — weaving between bodies, eyes searching.

Then—

A **burst of music** from a nearby doorway.

Samir appears in the pocket of light spilling onto the street —  
dancing with huge, exaggerated moves,  
hands over his head,  
hips doing something only Samir would call dancing.

A few feet away, Chloë stands with her drink,  
eyes closed,  
swaying gently to the beat,  
completely in her own world.

Maya stops.  
Relief softens her shoulders.  
Her smile returns — smaller at first, then full.

She dance-walks toward them, slipping back into the rhythm like a tide returning to shore.

Samir sees her and yells something joyful.  
Chloë opens one eye, grins, and lifts her drink in greeting.

Maya slides in between them, caught by the music again.

The street is a riot of lights and noise — brass bands, neon signs, people yelling from balconies.  
A group of drunk guys above shout down, holding strings of beads like trophies.

**GUY ON BALCONY**  
“Who wants beads?! Show us somethin’!”

Chloë’s eyes light up.  
Maya laughs nervously — she already knows where this is going.

Chloë sashays forward like she owns the entire French Quarter.  
She flips her shirt up with zero hesitation, flashing the balcony crew.

The guys erupt — cheering, howling.  
Beads rain down in a glittering arc.

Chloë catches them like a pro, does a tiny victorious shimmy.

She turns to Maya, eyes sparkling.

**CHLOË**  
“Your turn!”

**MAYA**  
(laughing, mortified)  
“No. No way. Absolutely not.”

The guys spot Maya and start chanting.  
More beads dangle.  
More noise.

Chloë drapes her beads around Maya’s neck —  
leaning in close enough that Maya can smell the sugar from her hurricane cocktail.

Maya looks up at the balcony — the noise, the laughter, the stupid exuberant joy.  
She looks back at Chloë — fearless, bright, alive in a way Maya sometimes _wishes_ she could be.

Maya’s breath catches.

This isn’t peer pressure.  
This is admiration.  
Inspiration.  
Permission.

She turns away, thinking —  
then turns back with a tiny, nervous smile.

**MAYA**  
“Okay… screw it.”

Chloë claps, startled but delighted.

Maya steps forward.  
Her hands shake a little.  
She looks up again — the balcony crew chanting, beads swaying, a stupid, chaotic moment that suddenly feels… safe.

She exhales —  
lifts her shirt —  
JUST enough —  
quick, shy, barely a flash —  
and the balcony explodes with cheers.

Beads rain down like a shower of neon.

Maya laughs — a real laugh, deeper than her earlier ones.

Chloë grabs her arm, pulling her back into the throng.

**CHLOË**  
“See?! That’s what I’m talking about!”

They all burst out laughing.

**CUT.**

**INT. KITTYKAT24’S ROOM – NIGHT**

Kitty is kneeling on her bed, hair in a messy half-bun, holding a floppy sunhat with fake flowers on it. She’s trying very hard to look serious.

**KITTY**  
“Okay. Precision. Synchronization. Grace.  
We are ballet.”

**INT. KAI’S APARTMENT – SAME**

Kai squints skeptically at the ball cap he’s holding.

**KAI**  
“I don’t think ballet involves hats, Kitty.”

**KITTY (V.O.)**  
“It does TONIGHT.”

**INT. SKATTERBRAIN’S ROOM – SAME**

SkatterBrain is adjusting a beanie dramatically, like he’s about to walk a runway.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“Let the art begin.”

**KITTY (V.O.)**  
“Okay— Kai throws first.  
I catch.  
Then I toss to Skatter.  
Easy.”

Kai nods. Very serious.  
He raises his hat like he’s lining up a perfect curveball.

**KAI**  
“On three.  
One—”

He immediately YEETS the hat off-frame.

**KITTY**  
(screaming)  
“KAI!!  
THAT WAS ZERO!  
THAT WAS NEGATIVE ONE!”

Kitty flails backward on her bed, cackling.  
SkatterBrain falls out of his chair laughing.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“My dude threw it before the thought even finished forming—”

Kai covers his face, laughing so hard he can’t breathe.

**KAI**  
“I panicked! My arm betrayed me!”

Kitty resets, breathless.

**KITTY**  
“Okay. For real this time.  
Three.  
Two.  
One—”

Kai tosses his hat.  
Kitty reaches for it—  
and mistimes completely, grabbing at empty air.

The hat bounces off her shoulder and disappears behind the bed.

She collapses.  
Silent laugh. Full-body shake.

**KITTY**  
“CUT! CUT!  
We’ll fix it in post!”

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“We are NOT nailing this.  
We are not even nailing the concept of numbers.”

Kai’s laughing so hard he slides halfway out of frame.

**KAI**  
“One more.  
I swear.  
We’re geniuses. We got this.”

Kitty wipes tears from her eyes.

**KITTY**  
“We absolutely do not.”

But they line up again anyway —  
because the fun is the failure.

**CUT.**

### EXT. BOURBON STREET – NIGHT

Music, bodies, voices stacked on top of each other.

Maya, Chloe, and Samir drift down the street, drinks in hand, laughing mid-story. Chloe bumps Samir with her shoulder. Samir stumbles theatrically. Maya spins once, nearly spilling her drink, doesn’t care.

A **street evangelist** stands near the curb, speaking to no one in particular, voice steady, practiced. A small wooden cross rests against his chest.

A few people nearby argue back and forth with him — overlapping voices, conviction brushing up against frustration. It’s loud. It’s part of the street.

Maya keeps moving.

She sways to the music pouring out of a bar and ends up dancing next to someone in glitter boots. No pause. No acknowledgement of context. Just rhythm.

The person laughs and dances back.

Chloe, still laughing at something Samir said, turns — and suddenly she’s right in front of the evangelist.

She raises her glass in a friendly half-toast, then, on impulse, offers her hand.

He blinks. Smiles despite himself. Takes it.

They sway — awkward, polite, almost formal — like two people who have nothing to prove to each other.

Samir claps along to the beat, loud and off-time, drawing a cheer from somewhere behind him. Someone joins in. Someone spins.

The arguing voices thin out, swallowed by laughter and movement. Not gone — just blended into the noise.

Chloe releases the evangelist with a small bow and rejoins Maya and Samir without comment.

They move on, already talking over each other again, already laughing.

Behind them, the street resets — voices rise, music shifts, bodies flow.

The night keeps going.

**CUT.**

**INT. KITTYKAT24’S ROOM – NIGHT**

Kitty is stretched across her bed, scrolling her phone casually while the others chatter.  
She pauses.  
Brows lift.

**KITTY**  
“Oh— hey, Skatter.  
What’s this link you just posted on Insta?”

**INTERCUT TO:**

**INT. SKATTERBRAIN’S ROOM – SAME**

SkatterBrain doesn’t flinch.  
Just shrugs, sipping from a can.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“Oh.  
My uncle’s GoFundMe.  
Hospital bill stuff.”

**INTERCUT TO:**

**INT. KAI’S APARTMENT – SAME**

Kai perks up, leaning a little closer to his mic.

**KAI**  
“Send it.”

Kitty already is.  
Her thumbs move fast.

**KITTY (V.O.)**  
“Just did.  
Sucks, man.  
Hope he’s doing okay.”

SkatterBrain nods once — not emotional, not guarded — just matter-of-fact.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“Yeah, he’s hanging in there.”

**INTERCUT TO: KITTY**

She taps on her screen a few times, sits upright slightly.

**KITTY**  
“I tossed in a few bucks.  
Nothing wild.  
Just— you know.”

**INTERCUT TO: KAI**

Kai’s already doing the same on his phone.

**KAI**  
“Me too.”

**INTERCUT BACK TO: SKATTERBRAIN**

SkatterBrain smiles — a real one — small, warm.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“Thanks, guys.  
Seriously.”

**INTERCUT: KITTY**

She waves a hand dismissively, even though they can’t see it.

**KITTY**  
“Dude, please.  
We’re friends.  
That’s what this is.”

**INTERCUT: KAI**

Kai nods, relaxed.

**KAI**  
“Yeah.  
Love you, man.”

**INTERCUT: SKATTERBRAIN**

He smirks, leaning back in his chair like he’s brushing off embarrassment he doesn’t actually feel.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“Love you too, dorks.”

They sit in a comfortable, unforced silence for half a beat —  
then someone burps, or coughs, or rustles a chip bag,  
and life just… continues.

**END INTERCUT.**

---

**EXT. BOURBON STREET – NIGHT**

The night has thinned — the crowd still buzzing, but looser now, stragglers drifting between bars.  
Music fades in and out as doors open and close.

A **busker** sits on the curb near a shuttered doorway.  
Guitar in his lap.  
Head down.  
Not performing — just existing.  
The kind of stillness that makes the chaos around him feel louder.

Maya notices him first.  
Not because he looks pitiful or dangerous —  
but because something in his posture feels… honest.

She slows.  
Chloë, ever protective, instinctively reaches for her elbow.  
Maya gently pulls free.

She steps toward him.

**MAYA**  
“Hey… you doing okay?”

The busker looks up.  
Eyes tired, but present.  
Older than he should be.  
He studies her face, unsure why she stopped.

**BUSKER**  
“Just trying to stay warm.  
Trying to stay… in the world.”

Maya nods, something soft opening in her chest.

She reaches into her small crossbody purse —  
not for money, not for a trinket —  
and pulls out a simple **business card**:

**“Lefevre Antiques  
Est. 1954  
French Quarter  
Ask for Maya or Grandma Rosa”**

It’s a real piece of her life.  
A private doorway.

She holds it out.

The busker hesitates — then takes it carefully, like it might break.

**MAYA**  
“We open at ten most days.  
If you come by…  
I can get you some blankets.  
Or coffee.  
Or just… somewhere warm to sit for a minute.”

The busker's face cracks — not into a smile, but into something deeper:

**recognition.**

Someone saw him.  
Someone cared enough to offer a place, not just pity.

**BUSKER**  
“You’d do that?  
For me?”

**MAYA**  
(soft, earnest)  
“For anyone who needed it.”

The busker swallows — overwhelmed in a quiet, human way.

He tucks the card into his jacket like it’s valuable.

**BUSKER**  
“You have a good heart.  
Hope it stays that way.”

Chloë calls gently from a distance:

**CHLOË**  
“Maya…? Everything okay?”

Maya nods without looking back.

**MAYA**  
“Yeah.  
Just…  
talking.”

She stands, gives the man a last warm glance, and joins her friends.  
They walk off into the glowing chaos.

The busker watches her go.  
Then looks down at the business card again,  
softly touching the embossed lettering like it’s a lifeline.

**CUT.**

### SLOW-MOTION MONTAGE – DANCING – NIGHT

_Dark Rain_ stretches, bass heavy, almost internal.

---

**MAYA**

Close on her face as she moves — eyes soft, present. Light slides across her skin. A small smile forms, unguarded.

---

**CHLOE**

Laughing silently, head tipped back. Hair lifts, settles. She dances with ease, grounded, graceful.

---

**SAMIR**

A wide grin. Shoulders rolling, arms loose. He moves like joy is contagious — because it is.

---

**KAI**

Close on Kai — flushed, buzzing, alive. His head snaps with the beat. He laughs mid-move, unstoppable.

---

**KITTYKAT**

Controlled, confident. Subtle movement — a hip shift, a shoulder roll. Eyes steady, knowing, enjoying the moment.

---

**SKATTERBRAIN**

Energy sharp and precise. Head nodding hard, then a grin breaks through as he throws himself fully into it.

---

**INTERCUT – DETAILS**

– Eyes closing  
– Breath leaving lips  
– Hair in motion  
– Hands lifting, dropping

No wide shots.  
No spectacle.

---

**MAYA & CHLOE**

They catch each other’s eye, share a smile, spin past one another.

---

**KAI & SKATTERBRAIN**

Mirroring each other’s movement for a beat — competitive, playful — then breaking into laughter.

---

**KITTYKAT**

Watching them for half a second, amused — then joining, effortless.

---

**SAMIR**

At the center for a moment, laughing, arms out, pulling the energy together.

---

**FINAL IMAGE**

All six overlap in motion — not posed, not grouped — just briefly sharing the same rhythm.

The music carries them.

**CUT.**

**EXT. BOURBON STREET – NIGHT**

Music spills out from a bar — brass, bass, people yelling in joy and half-drunken chaos.  
Inside, the packed dance floor is a moving organism — bodies compressed, lights flickering, sweat and neon everywhere.

**INT. BOURBON STREET BAR – CONTINUOUS**

MAYA, a little tipsy and glowing from the night, dances with **CHLOE** and **SAMIR**.  
It’s loose, stupid, joyful — hips swaying, hands in the air, laughing at nothing and everything.

They move as one unit, like a mini swarm in the larger chaos.

Then —

**Maya bumps someone.**

A solid chest.  
A moment of pressure.  
A hand reflexively steadies her elbow.

She turns.

**It’s MARCUS.**

He’s barely lit by the pulsing LED wash, but it hits him right:  
sharp jaw, soft eyes, the kind of face that looks like trouble in all the good ways.

Maya’s breath stutters — not dramatically, just enough that the camera catches her micro-freeze.

Marcus offers a small, crooked smile.  
Not cocky.  
Not cheesy.  
Just _aware._

Maya smiles back.  
Her whole expression softens, like she forgot she had muscles in her face until now.

They start moving together —  
not touching, not grinding,  
just _mirroring._  
Strong eye contact.  
Bodies swaying to the same beat.

The crowd blurs around them.

Maya doesn’t even blink.

Suddenly—

**CHLOE (O.S.)**  
(shouting over music)  
“I’m gonna get another drink! You want anything?”

Chloe is right at Maya’s shoulder, but Maya barely registers her.  
Her eyes stay locked on Marcus — a kind of gravity pulling her forward.

**MAYA**  
(still staring at Marcus)  
“Um… I… I’m good.”

Marcus laughs quietly — a warm, genuine laugh — like he can’t believe how cute this is.

Maya mirrors it.  
They’re locked in a tiny private universe while the bar crashes around them.

In the background:

Chloe walks away —  
but halfway to the bar, she turns, looks back.

Her face shifts.  
A tiny flicker of realization:

**Oh.  
We lost her.**

She continues on, disappearing into the crowd.

Back on Maya & Marcus:

He leans in slightly, finally about to speak —  
some opening line, silly or smooth or mundane, doesn’t matter.

Maya feels the pull.  
She wants to stay.  
Her body leans before her mind does.

Then —

She catches herself.

A breath.  
A blink.  
A flicker of loyalty.

**MAYA**  
(soft, almost regretful)  
“Hey… um… it was really nice meeting you, but…  
I think I _do_ need to get that drink.”

Marcus nods, surprised but respectful.  
A small smile — the “I get it” kind.

She steps back, almost stumbling as the crowd swallows her.

Maya slips through the bodies, finds Chloe by the bar, throws her arms around her from behind with a ridiculous laugh —  
CHLOE jumps, then laughs too.  
SAMIR appears with some insane neon drink, hyped as always.

The trio reconnect.  
Loud, messy, alive.

In the distance,  
Marcus watches Maya.  
Not pining — just…  
curious.  
Amused.  
Noticing.

Then he fades back into the crowd.

**CUT.**

NT. KAI’S COMPUTER SUITE – NIGHT**

Kai is deep in the glow.  
Laughing with his online friends.  
Screens alive.  
Music thumping.  
Everything rhythmic and alive.

Then—  
His phone buzzes.

**MOM** flashes on the screen.

The whole room seems to go quiet, even though nothing actually stops.  
Kai’s face slackens — not fear, not anger…  
more like a subtle dissociation, a shutting door behind his eyes.

He answers because he always answers.

**KAI**  
“Hey.”

**MOM (V.O. — sharp, clipped, immediate)**  
“You didn’t return my text. Again.”

Kai’s posture collapses inward.  
His voice gets smaller by a degree almost invisible unless you’re looking for it.

She launches into a barrage —  
criticism disguised as concern,  
concern disguised as control.

- Why didn’t he call earlier?
    
- Why hasn’t he visited?
    
- Why is he wasting time on games?
    
- Why can’t he be more like his cousin?
    
- Why isn’t he saving money?
    
- Why won’t he listen when she tells him what’s best?
    

None of it loud.  
None of it dramatic.  
Just constant.

Kai stares at the RGB reflection on his desk.  
His friends are talking in his headphones — muffled, distant, like another planet.

He murmurs standard responses:  
“Yeah.”  
“I know.”  
“I’ll try.”  
“Okay.”  
“Yes.”  
“No, that’s not what I— nevermind.”

He shrinks further.

Finally, she says something that hits too deep —  
something about responsibility, or shame, or “the way you were raised.”  
It doesn’t matter which — it lands.

Kai inhales.

**KAI**  
“I’m gonna go. I’ve got a thing. I’ll… call you later.”

A beat.  
A scoff from the other end.  
A click.

He lowers the phone.  
Doesn’t move for a long moment.

Then his monitor flickers —  
a friend yelling, laughing, pulling him back.

Kai slips on his headset again.  
He exhales.

**KAI**  
“Hey — sorry, guys. What’d I miss?”

The glow washes him back into the world where he feels whole.

**CUT.**

# ⭐ **FINALE INTERCUT — “PIZZA COLLAGE”**

_(Final sequence of Episode 3 — 400+ words, cinematic, rhythmic, montage-driven)_

**EXT. BOURBON STREET – NIGHT**

Maya, Samir, and Chloë weave through the crowd, sweat-damp and glowing from the neon. The noise is still loud, but their energy has softened — the post-adventure lull.

Chloë slows first.

**CHLOË**  
“Okay… is it just me…  
or am I starving?”

**WIPE-PAN TO:**

**INT. KAI’S APARTMENT – SAME**

Kai is reclined in his chair, hand on his stomach.

**KAI**  
“I’m hungry.”

**WIPE-PAN TO:**

**INT. KITTYKAT24’S ROOM – SAME**

Kitty pauses mid-scroll, raises her hand like she’s confessing in class.

**KITTY**  
“Same.”

**WIPE-PAN TO:**

**INT. SKATTERBRAIN’S ROOM – SAME**

SkatterBrain stops mid-rant about something stupid, blinks.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“…me three.”

**CUT BACK TO:**

**EXT. BOURBON STREET**

Maya lifts her hands in surrender.

**MAYA**  
“Food.  
Now.”

Samir nods emphatically.

**SAMIR**  
“I don’t even care what.”

Chloë giggles.

**CHLOË**  
“Same.”

**WIPE-PAN — FAST, MUSICAL — THROUGH ALL SIX FACES**

Kai → Kitty → Skatter → Maya → Samir → Chloë  
Each saying some version of:

**“What do we even eat?”**  
**“No idea.”**  
**“Something greasy.”**  
**“Something fast.”**  
**“Anything.”**

The audio overlaps — not chaotic, but rhythmic, like a beat.

Then:

A moment of stillness.

All six faces, side by side in a **six-way split screen**, eyes tracking something unseen.

**ALL OF THEM**  
“Pizza.”

A beautiful, stupid, communal decision.

**CUT TO WIDE COLLAGE:**

# ⭐ **THE PIZZA MONTAGE**

**EXT. FRENCH QUARTER PIZZA SHOP – NIGHT**

Maya spots it first.  
She gasps dramatically.

**MAYA**  
“Oh hell YES.”

Samir throws his hands up in victory.  
Chloë takes Maya’s arm and the trio _skip_ toward the glowing storefront like drunk children.

**INSIDE:**

They collapse into a red vinyl booth.  
Three enormous slices hit the table.  
Steam rises.  
Cheese stretches.  
They moan in ecstatic unison.

**CHLOË**  
“Worth it.”

**SAMIR**  
“Worth everything.”

**WIPE-PAN TO:**

**INT. SKATTERBRAIN’S ROOM – SAME**

SkatterBrain is hunched before his toaster oven, staring through the glass like he’s communicating with the spirits.

The tiny frozen pizza rotates slowly.

SkatterBrain whispers reverently:

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
“Cook, my son.”

**DING.**

He rips it out, hops onto his bed, folds the slice like a New Yorker, takes a massive bite—

—and immediately burns his tongue.

**SKATTERBRAIN**  
(shrieking)  
“HOT—  
Hot— hot— HOT— why is it SO HOT—???”

He keeps eating anyway.

**WIPE-PAN TO:**

**INT. KITTYKAT24’S HOUSE – SAME**

Kitty wanders downstairs into a quiet, too-big, softly lit kitchen.

She opens the fridge.  
Inside: a half-eaten pizza box from a place fancy people pretend is casual.

She steals a cold slice like she’s breaking into a vault.

Takes a bite.  
Her eyes close with bliss.

**KITTY**  
“Mmm. Religious.”

**WIPE-PAN TO:**

**INT. KAI’S APARTMENT – SAME**

Kai scrolls his food app with the focus of a sniper.

**KAI**  
“C’mon… be open… be open…”

He taps.  
Swipes.  
Selects.  
Waits.

**DOORBELL RINGS.**

Kai lights up.

He snatches the box from the delivery guy, drops back into his chair, opens the lid like it’s treasure.

One bite.  
Full exhale.

**KAI**  
“Yum.”

# ⭐ **FINAL SHOT**

**SIX-WAY SPLIT SCREEN:**

- Maya biting her slice, laughing through melted cheese
    
- Samir devouring his like a caveman
    
- Chloë snapping a photo of Maya mid-bite
    
- SkatterBrain fanning his burnt tongue but still eating
    
- Kitty blissed out from cold pizza nirvana
    
- Kai reclined in his chair, box in his lap, perfectly content
    

The ambient sounds fade.  
_Dark Rain_ settles into a soft outro version.

Six worlds.  
Six rooms.  
Six slices.

One moment.
