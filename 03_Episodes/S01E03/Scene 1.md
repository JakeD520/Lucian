(Drama - Dark Rain)

### **INT. KAI’S APARTMENT – NIGHT**

_(“Dark Rain” already mid-groove. 120 BPM heartbeat under everything.)_

Monitors spill violet light across a **cluttered desk**—half-empty cans, controller cords like vines.  
A gaming chair squeaks in time with the beat.

**ON-SCREEN (reflections flicker):** capture-the-flag map. Neon haze. HUD blinking red.

Kai’s jaw is tight, headset mic inches from his mouth.

**KAI**  
(laughing)  
Bro, I told you—don’t rush mid. You always rush mid.

**VOICE 1 (O.S.)**  
I had the flag!

**KAI**  
You had a _death wish_. Watch—watch this line-up.

_He flicks the mouse. Sniper shot. A body pixel-pops. The bass hits with it—perfect sync._

**VOICE 2 (O.S.)**  
Jesus, Kai, chill—save some for the rest of us.

**KAI**  
Nah, I’m on fire tonight.  
(next breath, cocky)  
Rain or shine, baby.

*(He swigs an energy drink. “Dark Rain” lyric—_you make me feel alive in the dark rain_—_bleeds faintly from his Bluetooth speaker.)_

The team chat dissolves into laughter, callouts, mock-shouting—chaos that feels like friendship.

Camera drifts past the monitors:  
– pizza box cities  
– LED strips pulsing in rhythm  
– posters curling on the wall

Kai’s face glows with the confidence of someone who’s never missed a shot **and hasn’t had to think past the next match**.

**VOICE 3 (O.S.)**  
We push left on three?

**KAI**  
On _my_ three.  
(smirk)  
One… two—  
**(beat drop)**  
Three.

_He launches forward; the chair wheels squeal across the tile._

Cut between his focus and flashes of kill-feed text—his handle climbing the leaderboard.

**VOICE 1 (O.S.)**  
MVP again. Somebody’s gotta humble you, man.

**KAI**  
Good luck. I’m the algorithm, baby.

He leans back, victorious grin half in shadow.  
The chorus of **“Dark Rain”** swells; synths shimmer against gunfire.  
For a moment the music, laughter, and digital violence all merge—  
**youth as rhythm, not thought.**

Camera pulls slowly away from him—through the open window, into the humid night.  
Rain starting to fall.  
Same tempo.  
Same beat.
