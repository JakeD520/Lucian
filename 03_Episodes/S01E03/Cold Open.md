# 🌙 **S01E03 — COLD OPEN**

_(Before the title card, before music fully rises.)_

## **INT. MAYA’S APARTMENT – NIGHT**

**CLOSE ON** Maya’s lips in the mirror.  
She’s applying lipstick with razor precision — then smudges it with her fingertip to make it look “effortless.”

Bathroom light = too bright.  
Hallway neon LED strip = too soft.  
Her friends are already laughing in the background.

Chloe (O.S.):

> “MAYAAA, let’s goooo! I’m thirsty!”

Maya checks herself one last time.

**CLOSE SHOT:**  
Her hand runs through her hair — too fast, too chaotic.  
She exhales.  
She smiles at herself.  
It’s the “tonight is ours” smile.

She grabs her phone.  
Full charge.  
Full bars.

She pockets it.

**Maya (to mirror):**

> “Okay… stay together this time.”

She kills the bathroom light.

**CUT TO BLACK — boom — we switch worlds.**

## **INT. KAI’S BEDROOM – SAME NIGHT**

**HARD CUT** to the glow of RGB LEDs.

Kai adjusts his headset in his monitor reflection — the same “mirror moment” as Maya’s, but digital.

He fixes a stray piece of hair with his palm.  
Not for vanity.  
For the camera.

He taps his mic.

**Discord connects — little bloop-bloop sounds.**  
Tiny face icons flash to life across his screen.

Saber_Knight:

> “Yoo! Kaiii! There he is!”

Jinx:

> “Let’s go, squad’s back tonight!”

Kai sits forward, excited.

Kai:

> “Okay — tonight? Nobody dips.  
> No random AFKs.  
> We’re actually staying together.”

They all cheer.

**His webcam preview flickers.**  
For half a second, Kai’s reflected face freezes — a tiny glitch, like foreshadowing.

He doesn’t notice.  
He puts his headphones on fully.

**CUT TO—**

## **INT. MAYA’S APARTMENT – NIGHT**

Maya opens the door.  
Chloe is waiting with three other friends, all chaotic energy.

Chloe (grabbing Maya’s wrist):

> “We stick together tonight, okay?  
> I’m serious.  
> LIKE.  
> Super serious.”

Everyone laughs — including Maya.

**Cue DRAMA – “Dark Rain” (slow fade-in).**

## **INTERCUT — MAYA AND KAI LEAVING THEIR WORLDS**

**MAYA’S GROUP:**  
Pouring out into the hallway, heels clacking, glitter everywhere, someone yelling “SHOTGUN FRONT SEAT!” before remembering they’re Ubering.

**KAI’S CREW:**  
All their icons lighting up on Discord.  
Someone’s cat walks across their keyboard.  
Someone else’s mic peaks.  
Someone is already eating chips too loudly.

Kai (smiling big):

> “Okay! Staying together.  
> No one vanish.”

**Maya:**

> “Okay! Staying together.  
> No one vanish.”

**Perfect overlay moment.**

One spoken IRL.  
One spoken digitally.  
Same line.  
Same rhythm.  
Same youthful hope.  
Different worlds.

## **EXT. MAYA’S STREET – NIGHT**

Door swings open — Bourbon Street lights already distant but calling.

**CLOSE on Maya’s face** as neon reflections hit her eyes.

She steps out into the heat, noise, and chaos of the city.

---

## **INT. KAI’S ROOM**

Kai pulls his rolling chair closer.  
Monitor glow washes him in soft blue.

**The first big bass hit of “Dark Rain” syncs with him clicking “Join Voice.”**
