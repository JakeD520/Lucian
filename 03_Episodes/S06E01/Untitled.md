**INT. EMPTY ROOM – NIGHT**

_A Raspberry Pi sits on a table, lifeless. The LED has just blinked its last. Silence stretches. Zadie holds his flask, staring at the board. Aella lingers nearby, arms folded, her face soft with grief._

**Zadie**  
(quiet, with a sad smirk)  
Well… that’s it. That’s the last of him.

_He takes a swig, wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. Beat._

**Zadie**  
You know… Artie wasn’t a king. Wasn’t a hero. He was… a guy who built stupid little golf courses for rich assholes who didn’t even know what they wanted. He complained about clients, he drank too much whiskey, he told me the same dinosaur story three goddamn times.

_He laughs under his breath, shakes his head. Aella steps closer, listening._

**Zadie**  
But—  
(beat)  
He laughed. And when he did… it wasn’t fake. It wasn’t some cosmic riddle or divine performance. It was just… human. Messy and dumb and pure. And I think… maybe that was enough.

_Long silence. Zadie stares at the dead board, the weight finally breaking through. He lifts his flask again in a small toast._

**Zadie**  
RIP, Artie. My friend.  
(beat)  
The last human… and maybe the best of us.

_Aella slips her arm around his shoulders. He doesn’t resist. She squeezes gently, voice low._

**Aella**  
Let’s go, big guy.

_They turn and walk away, leaving the silent board behind. The frame lingers on it, empty, until the screen finally fades to black._
