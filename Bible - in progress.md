# **CRYSTAL GARDENS – SERIES BIBLE TEMPLATE (CREATOR DRAFT)**

_This is the lean, clean, industry-standard structure you can start writing into._

---

### **Series Title**

**Crystal Gardens**

---

### **Logline**

**As humanity retreats into digital divinity, a family of immortal siblings fractures — each forced to confront purpose, legacy, and the terrifying silence of their absent creator.**

---

### **Series Premise**

**Crystal Gardens** is a serialized, mythic drama that reimagines the Lucifer archetype through a character-driven, cosmic lens.

At the beginning of all things, the Source — an unknowable creator — splintered himself into nine immortal siblings known as the **Enneagon**. Born in **Serim Aeterna**, a timeless plane where memory, art, and myth converge, they carry humanity’s creations as snapshots of existence.

They have lived among humanity ever since — once worshipped, now simply part of the world’s quiet background. They move through cities and eras with the ease of beings who have seen civilizations rise and fall, each drawn to different corners of human life.

For millennia, this balance held in fragile harmony… until **Lucian**, the “First Light,” witnesses a new crisis: humanity’s accelerating abandonment of the physical world in favor of immersive digital paradises. To him, this marks not progress — but extinction.

Against ancient consensus, and risking the only family he has, Lucian chooses to intervene.

His decision splinters the immortal siblings, dividing them along questions of purpose, compassion, legacy, and their own unresolved wounds. As humanity drifts ever deeper into artificial worlds, the family confront an unbearable truth: they are divine **orphans** — beings with no mandate, no creator returning, and no certainty about their place in the universe.

**Crystal Gardens** asks:  
What happens when the Created loves creation more than the Creator ever did? And when gods lose their mirror, what remains of their divinity?
