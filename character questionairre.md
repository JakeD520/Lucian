# Lucian- 
### **1. How do they appear when the audience first meets them?**

(What’s the initial “read”? Energy, posture, attitude, behavior.)
Contemplative, with a reluctant child underneath.  Confident and powerful.  Respected by peers.  Being referred to as "First Light" implies higher  status (although he does not consider himself above the others).

### **2. What is their emotional wound?**

(The deep insecurity, fear, or pain they carry — even if they hide it.)
The need to predict.  Fear of exposing others (like, how he is reluctant to tell Lyra about his prediction.)  Feeling like his insights are his burden to bear.  

### **3. What pressure are they under when the series begins?**

(Not cosmic lore — the immediate emotional situation affecting them.)
Isolation...alone in his decision making. Unable to share with his family.

### **4. How do they typically behave around the other siblings?**

(Do they soften? Harden? Get louder? Perform? Withdraw?)
Caring...soft.  His demeanor doesn't change around them.  As "First Light", the others often bend around him.

### **5. What do the other siblings misunderstand about them?**

(Every character is misinterpreted by their family in some way.)
His empathy towards humanity.  Pride..so to speak...his questioning of the competency of the Creator and his intentions.

### **6. What do _they_ misunderstand about themselves?**

(This reveals their arc foundation.)
He believes he is moving on altruism alone.  Like a "helper" who doesn't face the fact that their identity as helper identifies others as needing help.  Pride-fullness disguised as altruism.
### **7. What is their Season 1 trajectory?**

(Emotionally — not plot-wise. How are they being pulled or pushed?)
Stable observer to heightened anger and frustration.  

### **8. What contradictions make them interesting to play?**

(Examples: gentle but stubborn, confident but insecure, smart but impulsive.)
Confident but confused.  Ancient but treading new ground.  Wise and intellectual but ignorant. Powerful, yet powerless.

### **9. What is one small, human behavior that reveals who they are?**

(A gesture, habit, micro-action: e.g., “picks lint off things,” “doesn’t make eye contact,” “arrives early but pretends they didn’t.”)
Slow, focused movements (except when he isn't.  i.e. - when he's play sword-fighting Rexus with the prop swords.) Articulate.

### **10. What is the thing they want but don’t know how to ask for?**

(This is gold for actors — it tells them what’s under all the behavior.)
Freedom...from the Pattern.
