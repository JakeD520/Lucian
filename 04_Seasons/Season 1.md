- Overall theme is letting go.
- 
- Seed a relationship between [[Aris Thorne]] and [[Sarah Keene]].
- Scrap [[Lucian]] and [[Lyra]] romance.

### **Season 1 Arc Skeleton (Kaelarys-only lens)**

**E01 – The Orphan Bombshell**

- She frames it casually, but it’s a wound: “We’re all orphans.”
    
- Outward: still composed, eldest sister.
    
- Inward: she’s just admitted to herself the Architect isn’t coming back.
    

**E02 – Lucian’s Concern for Humans**

- To Kaelarys, it reads as: _Lucian is more worried about strangers than his own family._
    
- Private crack: she smashes an object alone afterward — “You care about them, not us.”
    

**E03 – Lyra’s Compassion**

- Lyra sees beauty and grief in humanity. Kaelarys sees it as Lyra drifting from the family’s core.
    
- Private crack: telepathic brush-off (the “Go away” scene you imagined).
    

**E04 – Rexus’ Hedonism**

- She frames it as betrayal: “Even Rexus won’t stand with us.”
    
- Outward: scolding him, acting maternal.
    
- Inward: she’s terrified they’re all slipping away.
    

**E05 – Leadership Slip**

- She tries to take charge of a family decision but hesitates mid-sentence. Others glance at each other.
    
- Private crack: breaks down in her chambers, staring blankly out the window.
    

**E06 – Clash With Lucian**

- Their argument: Lucian = “Humans will end themselves.” Kaelarys = “We’re the ones splintering.”
    
- It’s projection — she’s really terrified of her own collapse.
    

**E07 – The Silent Altar**

- She tries a ritual to reach the Architect. No answer. She hides it.
    
- This scene shows she knows she has no divine mandate left.
    

**E08 – Finale**

- Outward: mask fully intact, playing eldest sister, telling everyone they must hold the line.
    
- Inward: she’s empty, eyes hollow.
    
- She watches Lucian walk into rebellion and thinks: _“He’s gone. I can’t stop it.”_
    
- Season ends with her mask still up — but the audience knows it’s brittle.
