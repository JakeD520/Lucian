- [[Kaelarys]] lets go of being the "responsible one".  She starts engaging self destructive behavior as her pendulum swings.  Ultimately, [[Rexus]] reels her back in.  I'm thinking an amusement park scene to the song [[LA Guns - Rip and Tear]]
- Seed a relationship between [[Aris Thorne]] and [[Sarah Keene]].
- Scrap [[Lucian]] and [[Lyra]] romance.
