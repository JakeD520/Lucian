### Season 6 Spine

**Act I (E01–E03): Loss & fracture**

- E01: Artie’s “blip” → sets tone, humanity gone.
    
- E02: Family’s grief, wandering, fractured.
    
- E03: _The Walk_ → Rexus leaves Lucian.
    

**Act II (E04–E05): Fragile reconnection**

- E04: _The Return_ → Rexus rejoins the family (wordless, operatic embrace with Kaelarys). The family feels a flicker of hope.
    
- E05: _Plans & Pulls_ → With Rexus back, they begin cautiously strategizing: how do we bring Lucian and Lyra back? Rexus has input, tension builds.
    

**Act III (E06–E08): Break, Betrayal, Ruin**

- E06: _Lucian’s Flip_ → rage at the immersed humans, smashing life supports, harming Lyra. The “no going back” moment.
    
- E07: _Lyra’s Return_ → broken by what happened, she rejoins the family. The catharsis of her sobbing acceptance into their arms, while Lucian spirals in isolation.
    
- E08: _Finale_ → Lucian’s last stand. Not grand cosmic fireworks, but tragic, desperate, him lashing out, losing — utterly alone.
